I still remember the first time we laid eyes on Hank. It was a sunny day in May, and we met him and his current owner in a park somewhere nearby, on neutral territory. And then, when we saw Hank, I quickly realized the gravity of the decision we were about to make. Because Hank was tail-waggingly perfect. So there was no question of passing on him, and holding out for a *better* dog. Because I couldnâ€™t imagine what a better dog would look like.
