Body:

Turns out there was a fatal bug in 17.4.0, which caused Notenik to crash when creating a new collection (or opening any collection containing only one note). 

This turned out to be a rookie coding error â€” trying to access the first item in a list with a subscript of 1, instead of a subscript of 0. 

I can't believe I coded this, and imagine it was an XCode "hallucination" that I let slip by my fingers without correction. 

XCode's "suggestions" are often helpful, but this is a bit of a red flag for me. 

I'll have to be more careful and intentional in the future.
