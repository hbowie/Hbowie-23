> As Nietzsche put it, if you have a why to live, you can bear almost any how. A meaningful life can be extremely satisfying even in the midst of hardship, whereas a meaningless life is a terrible ordeal no matter how comfortable it is.

We all seem to need meaning in our lives. None of us wants to live a meaningless existence. 

But the drive for meaning is not just a personal challenge, but also a societal issue. When our societies make it difficult for their members to find meaning in their lives, then bad things tend to happen: suicide, substance abuse, violence, unrest and disorder, as examples. 

But what brings us a sense of meaning? 

Here are some thoughts from a noted psychologist. 

> A meaningful activity is oriented toward a goal, one that, if accomplished, would have an impact on the world -- and this usually means that it has an impact on other people. This activity... has some structure -- it's the sort of thing that one can tell a story about, It connects to... spirituality and often connects to flow (leading to experience of self loss) and often brings you into close contact with other people and is often seen as morally virtuous.

Bloom's suggestive words seem like a good start. But what else do we need?

In order to create meaning for ourselves, I believe that we humans need all of the following ingredients. 

## 1. Group Affiliation

Each of us must feel in some way associated with one or more groups of fellow humans. These may consist of people we live with, or work with, or otherwise interact with on a regular basis. But such groups may also consist of more far-flung groups bound together with one another in some definite way. For these larger, more nebulous groups, common cultural artifacts often help to create and maintain group identity and group cohesion, and communicate group values. 

## 2. Shared Goals

Each group must have some shared goals that are important to its members. 

## 3. Shared Values

These are simply the things — qualities, or abilities, or characteristics, or norms, or objects — that are valued by each group. 

## 4. Ongoing Development

In order to build meaning, individuals and groups need to feel that they are learning, growing and developing, especially in terms of achieving their goals and manifesting their values. 

## 5. Skills

In order to deliver value to a group — in order to be valuable, and to be valued — one must possess some useful skills. 

## 4. Differentiation/Individuation

We humans like to feel that our skills and contributions are in some way unique, so that our value derives not just from general characteristics shared with many others, but from some that are special to ourselves. And we must feel some congruence between how we see ourselves, and how we are seen by others. 

## 7. Situational Knowledge

By this I mean not just general knowledge, but specific knowledge about one’s situation and environment: tactical knowledge of one's surroundings, if you will. Such knowledge is generally necessary in order to be able to apply skills in a useful manner. 

### 8. Opportunity

One needs an opportunity to be able to deliver value to a group. Windows of opportunity may come and go, depending on any number of factors. 

## 9. Autonomy

Humans do not enjoy feeling like automatons. Given all of the ingredients listed above, they need to feel some degree of freedom in terms of how and when they exercise their skills to deliver value to a group. They also need some freedom to experiment, in order to continue their development. 

## 10. Effort

If an accomplishment does not require some significant effort, then we are not likely to view it as very meaningful. 

## 11. Results

We need to see that the employment of our skills has actually yielded some valuable results. 

## 12. Recognition 

We need to receive some recognition from other group members concerning the worth of our efforts. Informal, casual, sincere recognition is often as or more important than formal recognition. 

## 13. Equity

Group contributions and benefits must be fairly distributed; decision-making for the group should be fair and inclusive; group norms should be practiced consistently and, when they are not, enforcement should be even-handed and fair, with graduated sanctions based on frequency and severity of lapses. 

## 14. Leisure

We all need some free time for rest and relaxation and play, and if our results and recognition don’t provide this, then we are likely to wonder if it’s all worth it.  

## Summary

These are the fourteen components that need to be present to enable individuals to experience meaning in their lives. 

When we take these all together, we can see that *meaning* is a sense that *my group is secure and flourishing* and *my position within the group is secure* and *my contributions to the group are valued*. 

If humans are frustrated in their attempts to build meaning in their lives, because one or more of these components are missing, then they will generally try to form/find new groups with which they can generate meaning for themselves. 

If these efforts are further frustrated, they may become depressed, aggressive, suicidal, and/or addicted to substances that provide them with fleeting sensations of something that feels much like meaning.
