<p>I&#8217;ve been thinking a lot lately about Dunbar&#8217;s Number, and how it applies to modern societies. </p>

<p>For those not familiar with the term, let me share a paragraph from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunbar%27s_number" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wikipedia entry</a> on the subject. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>Dunbar explained the principle informally as &#8220;the number of people you would not feel embarrassed about joining uninvited for a drink if you happened to bump into them in a bar.&#8221; Dunbar theorised that &#8220;this limit is a direct function of relative neocortex size. The limit imposed by neocortical processing capacity is simply on the number of individuals with whom a stable inter-personal relationship can be maintained&#8221;. The number has been proposed to lie between 100 and 250, with a commonly used value of 150. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>This number is based on observation of various human group sizes, including those of early hunter-gatherers and early farming villages. </p>

<p>And this number is frequently used today as a rule-of-thumb for constructing groups within larger organizations, including military organizations and commercial organizations. </p>
