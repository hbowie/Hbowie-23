</a>
<p>This is one of the many great songs released by The Grateful Dead on their <em>American Beauty</em> album from 1970. </p>

<p>That album is a classic for many reasons, but certainly one of its distinguishing features is its diversity of themes and moods. </p>

<p>This song appears third on the album, coming after &#8220;<a href="box-of-rain.html" class="wiki-link">Box of Rain</a>&#8221; and &#8220;Friend of the Devil,&#8221; and is a burst of pure abandoned joy, in contrast to its more serious and sombre predecessors. </p>

<p>As we look at (and listen to) the lyrics, I think it&#8217;s easy to see many parallels to the song &#8220;<a href="shady-grove.html" class="wiki-link">Shady Grove</a>.&#8221; They both present images of an idealized female, they both mix descriptions of this idealized woman with descriptions of nature, and they both sometimes blur the lines between the two &#8211; starting with the song titles: just as &#8220;Shady Grove&#8221; could refer to someplace in nature, or to a woman of that name, &#8220;Sugar Magnolia&#8221; could refer to a magnolia tree, or to a woman being identified by that name. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>Sugar Magnolia, blossom&#8217;s blooming,  <br />
Head&#8217;s all empty and I don&#8217;t care.  <br />
Saw my baby down by the river:  <br />
Knew she&#8217;d have to come up soon for air. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>This first verse lays out all the motifs that will be extended in the rest of the song: </p>
<ul>
<li>A celebration of the rich lushness of summer; </li>
<li>A joyful surrender to the senses; </li>
<li>An abandonment of strict rationality in favor of poetic whimsy;  <br />
</li>
<li>An appreciation of nature; </li>
<li>An appreciation for the singer&#8217;s partner; </li>
<li>An appreciation for the partner&#8217;s joy, energy and independence.  </li>
</ul>

<blockquote>

<p>Sweet blossom, come on, under the willow,  <br />
We can have high times if you&#8217;ll abide.  <br />
We can discover the wonders of nature  <br />
Rolling in the rushes down by the riverside. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>

<p>She&#8217;s got everything delightful;  <br />
She&#8217;s got everything I need.  <br />
Takes the wheel when I&#8217;m seeing double,  <br />
Pays my ticket when I speed.  </p>

<p>She come skimming through rays of violet  <br />
She can wade in a drop of dew  <br />
She don&#8217;t come and I don&#8217;t follow  <br />
Waits backstage while I sing to you  </p>

<p>She can dance a Cajun rhythm,  <br />
Jump like a Willys in four wheel drive.  <br />
She&#8217;s a summer love in the spring, fall and winter:  <br />
She can make happy any man alive.  </p>

<p>Sugar magnolia  <br />
Ringin&#8217; that blue bell  <br />
Caught up in sunlight  <br />
Come on out singing  <br />
I&#8217;ll walk you in the sunshine  <br />
Come on honey, come along with me  </p>

<p>She&#8217;s got everything delightful  <br />
She&#8217;s got everything I need  <br />
A breeze in the pines in the summer night moonlight  <br />
Crazy in the sunlight yes indeed  </p>

<p>Sometimes when the cuckoo&#8217;s crying  <br />
When the moon is halfway down  <br />
Sometimes when the night is dying  <br />
I take me out and I wander round  <br />
I wander round  </p>

<p>Sunshine daydream  <br />
Walking through the tall trees  <br />
Going where the wind goes  <br />
Blooming like a red rose  <br />
Breathing more freely  <br />
Light out singing  <br />
I&#8217;ll walk you in the morning sunshine  <br />
Sunshine daydream  <br />
Walk you in the sunshine  </p>
