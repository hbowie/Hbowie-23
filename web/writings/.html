				<h2>Core Beliefs</h2>

<div class="columns>">
	<div class="column">
		<p>These are the things I believe in â€” the elements of my personal belief system. Unlike many aspects of my writing, however, these are not meant to be idiosyncratic. In fact, I'm happy to offer these up as a set of principles and values that all of us might find reason to rally around here in the early stages of the 21st century.</p>

		<p>These are a set of twenty-eight ideas grouped into six categories. Each idea has a tag associated with it, so feel free to click on the tab button at the end of the description for more information.</p> 

<h2>A. Mission</h2>

<h3>1. mission</h3>

<p>Human individuals and organizations need some sense of meaning and purpose in order to live complete and satisfying lives, and such a mission inevitably involves a degree of concern and care for others. </p> <a class="core-tag" href="../../web/tags/mission.html">mission</a>

<h2>B. A Human Perspective</h2>

<h3>2. humanism</h3>

<p>Humanism emphasizes the value and agency of human beings, individually and collectively, without reference to any non-human authorities. </p> <a class="core-tag" href="../../web/tags/humanism.html">humanism</a>

<h3>3. art</h3>

<p>We humans create meaning for ourselves through storytelling. That is, we reflect on our experiences and then create narratives, images, shapes and sounds in order to communicate new and interesting perspectives to others.  The resulting works of art can then become important elements of our culture. </p> <a class="core-tag" href="../../web/tags/art.html">art</a>

<h3>4. written word</h3>

<p>The written word is an invaluable human tool for sharing information and ideas between members of a generation, as well as for passing along information and ideas from one generation to the next; that being said, we must always be aware of the fallibility of any particular text, especially in light of the evolving human condition. </p> <a class="core-tag" href="../../web/tags/written-word.html">written word</a>

<h2>C. Something Bigger than Ourselves</h2>

<h3>5. connection</h3>

<p>A feeling of caring connection to others is part of what makes us human, and is the central force that makes each one of us part of something larger than our individual selves. </p> <a class="core-tag" href="../../web/tags/connection.html">connection</a>

<h3>6. wonder</h3>

<p>A sense of wonder opens our hearts and minds to fresh perspectives and new possibilities. </p> <a class="core-tag" href="../../web/tags/wonder.html">wonder</a>

<h3>7. love</h3>

<p>Let us call love the apprehension of something outside of oneself, some being or form that is other than our self, and yet that affirms the possibility of a greater unity of which we are each but parts, a unity that leaves us still ourselves, and yet also part of something inestimably greater. </p>

<p>This intense feeling of deep affection may be felt in the presence of another person, or a group of people, or a work of art, or another living creature, or some element of the natural world, or in the embrace of the entire world around us. </p> <a class="core-tag" href="../../web/tags/love.html">love</a>

<h2>D. Rational Thought</h2>

<h3>9. evolution</h3>

<h3>11. critical thinking</h3>

<p>Humans generally achieve better outcomes when they avoid judging situations by their outward appearances, and instead look beneath the surfaces to search out objective facts and engage in reasoned analysis. </p> <a class="core-tag" href="../../web/tags/critical-thinking.html">critical thinking</a>

<h3>12. systemic</h3>

<p>In order to achieve positive outcomes from the complex social, economic and ecological systems in which we live, we must think systemically &#8211; rather than simply focusing on the individual actors within these systems &#8211; and we must identify root causes for our problems and take action as close to those roots as is practical. </p> <a class="core-tag" href="../../web/tags/systemic.html">systemic</a>

<h3>13. education</h3>

<p>It is in the best interests of society to assist in the education of its members. </p> <a class="core-tag" href="../../web/tags/education.html">education</a>

</p> <a class="core-tag" href="../../web/tags/rule-of-law.html">rule of law</a>

<h3>18. property</h3>

<h3>20. value creation</h3>

<p>It is in the best interests of society to encourage its citizens to engage in activities that will create value for themselves and others and society at large, and to allocate capital so that the greatest amount of it is available for use by those with the strongest likelihood of using it wisely. </p> <a class="core-tag" href="../../web/tags/value-creation.html">value creation</a>

<h3>21. sustainability</h3>
