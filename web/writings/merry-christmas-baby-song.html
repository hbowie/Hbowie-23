<p>Listen on <a href="https://music.apple.com/us/album/merry-christmas-baby/399650872?i=399651038" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Apple Music</a>. </p>

<p>This song was originally recorded in 1947 by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnny_Moore%27s_Three_Blazers" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Johnny Moore&#8217;s Three Blazers</a>, featuring <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Brown_(musician)" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Charles Brown</a> on piano and vocals. Composition credits are disputed, but it appears that Charles Brown had a large hand in the music, lyrics and original arrangement. </p>

<p>The original recording was a hit on the Rhythm and Blues charts, and the song has been recorded by many blues and R&amp;B artists down through the years, including respectful covers by Elvis Presley and Bruce Springsteen.  </p>

<p>The lyrics recount the happy tale of a man feeling appreciative of his wife/girlfriend on Christmas morning, after opening his many presents.  </p>

<p>The tune began life as a slow, quiet bluesy number, with relaxed vocals, and often with a piano tinkling quietly in the background. The original lyrics included the lines &#8220;Haven&#8217;t had a drink this morning, but I&#8217;m all lit up like a Christmas tree.&#8221; Even without this avowal, though, most early renditions conjure up visions of empty glasses and perhaps a few bottles interspersed with the presents. </p>

<p>But then, in 1967, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otis_Redding" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Otis Redding</a> and the famous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stax_Records#House_band" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Stax/Volt</a> house band &#8211; including Booker T. Jones on keyboards, Steve Cropper on guitar,  Donald &#8220;Duck&#8221; Dunn on bass and Al Jackson Jr. on drums &#8211; breathed new life into the composition with a soulful, uptempo rendition seemingly fueled by pure joy. While still relaxed, the locked-in rhythm section, organ and horns practically demand that the listener move in time to the music. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>Merry Christmas, baby,  <br />
Sure did treat me nice.  <br />
Merry Christmas, baby,  <br />
Sure did treat me nice.  <br />
Bought me a diamond ring for Christmas,  <br />
I feel like I&#8217;m in paradise.  </p>

<p>I feel mighty fine, y&#8217;all,  <br />
I&#8217;ve got music on my radio.  <br />
Feel mighty fine, girl;  <br />
I&#8217;ve got music on my radio.  <br />
I feel like I&#8217;m gonna kiss you,  <br />
Standing beneath that mistletoe.  </p>

<p>Santa came down the chimney,  <br />
Half past three, y&#8217;all.  <br />
Left all them good ole presents  <br />
For my baby and for me, ha, ha, ha!  </p>

<p>Merry Christmas baby,  <br />
Sure did treat me nice.  <br />
You bought me all those good ole presents.  <br />
I love you baby for the rest of my life.  </p>

<p>Merry Christmas, girl,  <br />
Merry, merry, merry Christmas baby.  <br />
Sure did treat me nice  <br />
Merry Christmas baby  <br />
I said you sure did treat me nice  <br />
You bought me all those lovely things, yeah  <br />
I feel like I&#8217;m in paradise.  </p>

<p>I wish you a merry Christmas baby,  <br />
Happy new year, ha  <br />
A merry Christmas, honey  <br />
Everything here is beautiful  <br />
I love you, baby  <br />
For everything that you give me  <br />
I love you, honey. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Otis adds many of his signature vocal embellishments to the song, including a heartfelt and deeply rhythmic &#8220;Ha Ha Ha!&#8221; somewhere in the middle, as well as an improvised ending allowed to fade out, but not before Redding remarks that &#8220;Everything here is beautiful!&#8221; </p>

<p>Jackson Browne may <a href="the-rebel-jesus-song-by-jackson-browne.html" class="wiki-link">grant us our right to &#8220;anything that frees us,&#8221; and bid us pleasure and cheer</a>, but it&#8217;s Redding who fully expresses those feelings for me. While this song is decidedly secular, Redding and his band make a convincing case that there&#8217;s a pure and untainted joy to be had from exchanging presents with loved ones in front of the tree on Christmas morning, while listening to good music on your radio, and I&#8217;m not going to be the one to argue with him. As long as I&#8217;ve got music like this to play, I&#8217;ll just turn it up and enjoy all the blessings the holiday may bring. </p>

<p>Redding&#8217;s recording is available on CD as part of a number of collections, but the best is the original <em>Soul Christmas</em> album. </p>
