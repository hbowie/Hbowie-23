<h2><span class="underline">Reference Summaries:</span></h2>


<p>I've occasionally run across models of various sorts that I've thought could be usefully summarized, especially for easy and practical reference when needed. What follows is a list of these writings.  </p>

<h3><a href="writings/core-design-principles-for-teams.html">Core Design Principles for Teams</a></h3>

<p>David Sloan Wilson and his pals at Prosocial World have done the heavy lifting for us, providing the eight Core Design Principles to maximize the effectiveness of human groups of all sizes. </p>

<h3><a href="writings/developmental-levels.html">Developmental Levels</a></h3>

<p>A number of authors and systems of thought espouse one or another series of developmental levels, in fields of study as diverse as psychology, sociology, economics and organizational development. Ken Wilber was the first author I encountered who proposed an integration of these various developmental progressions into a single unifying scheme. However, much of Ken&#8217;s take  on these levels was heavily influenced by the Spiral Dynamics work done by Clare W. Graves, Don Beck and Chris Cowan. </p>

<p>The following reference table lists the levels in this general, unifying model, showing the color schemes used by both Integral Theory and Spiral Dynamics. </p>

<h3><a href="writings/earned-value-management-evm-for-mere-mortals.html">Earned Value Management (EVM) for Mere Mortals</a></h3>

<p>Project managers often have to use some form of Earned Value Management (EVM) in order to monitor the progress of their projects. If this topic seems at all mysterious to you, then this piece will attempt to answer all of your questions. </p>

<h3><a href="writings/the-four-quadrants-of-human-knowledge.html">The Four Quadrants of Human Knowledge</a></h3>

<p>I first came across Ken Wilber&#8217;s work late in the last century when a friend handed me a copy of <cite>A Brief History of Everything</cite> as a birthday present. </p>

<h3><a href="writings/a-universal-improvement-process.html">A Universal Improvement Process</a></h3>

<p>These are the elements of a generalized improvement process, integrating components of natural selection, the scientific method and various disciplines for product and process improvement. </p>
