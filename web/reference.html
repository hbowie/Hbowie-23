			<h2>All of the Reference Summaries</h2>

			<p>I've occasionally run across models of various sorts that I've thought could be usefully summarized, especially for easy and practical reference when needed. What follows is a list of these writings.  </p>

			<h3><a href="writings/7-habits-of-highly-effective-people.html">7 Habits of Highly Effective People</a></h3>

<p>The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People&reg; is, of course, the famous list from Stephen R. Covey&#8217;s book of the same name. </p>

			<h3><a href="writings/core-design-principles-for-the-efficacy-of-groups.html">Core Design Principles for The Efficacy of Groups</a></h3>

<p>David Sloan Wilson and his pals at Prosocial World have done the heavy lifting for us, providing the eight Core Design Principles to maximize the effectiveness of human groups of all sizes. </p>

			<h3><a href="writings/developmental-levels.html">Developmental Levels</a></h3>

<p>A number of authors and systems of thought espouse one or another series of developmental levels, in fields of study as diverse as psychology, sociology, economics and organizational development. Ken Wilber was the first author I encountered who proposed an integration of these various developmental progressions into a single unifying scheme. However, much of Ken&#8217;s take  on these levels was heavily influenced by the Spiral Dynamics work done by Clare W. Graves, Don Beck and Chris Cowan. </p>

<p>The following reference table lists the levels in this general, unifying model, showing the color schemes used by both Integral Theory and Spiral Dynamics. </p>

			<h3><a href="writings/dramma-list-of-psychological-needs.html">DRAMMA List of Psychological needs</a></h3>

<p>DRAMMA stands for Detachment, Relaxation, Autonomy, Mastery, Meaning and Affiliation. </p>

			<h3><a href="writings/earned-value-management-evm-for-mere-mortals.html">Earned Value Management (EVM) for Mere Mortals</a></h3>

<p>Project managers often have to use some form of Earned Value Management (EVM) in order to monitor the progress of their projects. If this topic seems at all mysterious to you, then this piece will attempt to answer all of your questions. </p>

			<h3><a href="writings/the-four-quadrants-of-human-knowledge.html">The Four Quadrants of Human Knowledge</a></h3>

<p>The four quadrants come from the integral philosophy work of Ken Wilber. The four quadrants can be thought of as the subjective, the objective, the intersubjective and the interobjective. </p>

			<h3><a href="writings/motivational-factors-for-complex-work.html">Motivational Factors for Complex Work</a></h3>

<p>In is book <em>Drive: The Surprising Truth About What Motivates Us</em>, Daniel H. Pink identified three vital sources of extrinsic motivation for individuals engaged in something more complex than simple, straightforward tasks: autonomy, mastery and purpose. </p>

			<h3><a href="writings/the-rotary-four-way-test.html">The Rotary Four-Way Test</a></h3>

<p>This is a nonpartisan and nonsectarian ethical test that individuals can apply to their personal and professional relationships. The original author was Herbert J. Taylor. It was adopted by the Rotary organization in the 1940's. </p>

			<h3><a href="writings/self-determination-theory.html">Self-Determination Theory</a></h3>

<p>Self-Determination Theory identifies three basic psychological needs that must be satisfied to foster well-being and health: autonomy, competence and relatedness. </p>

			<h3><a href="writings/the-social-suite.html">The Social Suite</a></h3>

<p>Nicholas A. Christakis, in his book <em>Blueprint</em>, defines eight human features that form the core of all societies. As he says, these features arise from within individuals but they characterize groups, and so they form a relatively small set of universal features that supports the self-assembly of humans into societies. </p>

			<h3><a href="writings/social-support-survey.html">Social Support Survey</a></h3>

<p>This is a simple survey that anyone can use to self-assess the degree of social support they are feeling in their lives. I picked this up from David R. Samson&#8217;s book <em>Our Tribal Future</em>, but he says that he adapted it from other sources. </p>

			<h3><a href="writings/tribal-instincts.html">Tribal Instincts</a></h3>

<p>Michael Morris offers us three basic tribal instincts: to honor our ancestors through continuation of tradition, to mesh with our peers, and to pursue heroic contributions. </p>

			<h3><a href="writings/a-universal-improvement-process.html">A Universal Improvement Process</a></h3>

<p>These are the elements of a generalized improvement process, integrating components of natural selection, the scientific method and various disciplines for product and process improvement. </p>
