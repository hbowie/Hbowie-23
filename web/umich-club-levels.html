Alumni Club Maturity Levels</summary>
<p>by Herb Bowie </p>

<h5 id="a-little-background">A Little Background</h5>

<p>In my professional career I spent several years managing a process improvement office for software developers. We often made use of the Capability Maturity Model. The basic idea of such a model was that software development teams needed to proceed through a series of levels in order to improve, and that, if they were operating at level 1, they couldn&#8217;t suddenly try to adopt a practice from level 5 and expect to succeed. In other words, they needed to work their ways up through the levels gradually. </p>

<p>The other relevant aspect of this improvement approach is the recognition that teams could not effectively improve simply through compliance edicts, but generally needed coaching and guidance as well. </p>

<h5 id="application-to-aaum-and-its-clubs">Application to AAUM and its Clubs</h5>

<p>As we recently began discussing term limits for alumni club boards, something began to nag at me, and gradually it occurred to me that we might productively put together a set of maturity levels for alumni clubs, and so I started to outline what such a thing might look like. </p>

<p>So what follows is a proposed series of maturity levels for alumni clubs, defining appropriate goals and practices for each level. </p>

<p>This is just a start, but I think it worth some discussion. </p>

<p>I&#8217;ve categorized levels and practices using the following scheme: </p>
<ul>
<li><em>Gov</em> - Governance </li>
<li><em>Ops</em> - Operations </li>
<li><em>Comms</em> - Communications </li>
</ul>


<details>

<summary>
1. Organizational Level <em>(Gov)</em></summary>
<p>This is the initial level, consisting of the minimum practices necessary to establish and operate a club. </p>

<p>At this level, basic Governance practices are established. </p>

<details>

<summary>
1.1. Maintain and Follow Club Bylaws <em>(Gov)</em></summary>
<p>The club needs to have a set of bylaws, and needs to operate according to those bylaws. </p></details>

<details>

<summary>
1.2. Identify Board Members <em>(Gov)</em></summary>
<p>At a mimimum, the following officer positions should be filled. The officers are generally tasked with performing various Governance functions. </p>
<ul>
<li>President </li>
<li>Vice-President </li>
<li>Treasurer </li>
<li>Secretary </li>
</ul>

<p>A board should also contain one or more members of a Communications team, as well as one or more members of an Operations team. These teams may operate within the board itself, or as committees reporting to the board. </p></details>

<details>

<summary>
1.3. Hold Regular Board Meetings <em>(Gov)</em></summary>
<p>The board needs to have regular meetings, including an annual meeting open to all club members. </p></details>

<details>

<summary>
1.4. Maintain Club Records <em>(Gov)</em></summary>
<p>The board needs to maintain adequate records of the club&#8217;s activities. </p></details>

<details>

<summary>
1.5. Manage Finances Responsibly <em>(Gov)</em></summary>
<p>The board needs to have responsible management of its finances. </p></details>

<details>

<summary>
1.6. Operate Within AAUM Parameters <em>(Gov)</em></summary>
<p>The club needs to operate within parameters established and communicated by the AAUM. </p></details>
</details>

<details>

<summary>
2. Delivery Level <em>(Comms, Ops)</em></summary>
<p>This is the service delivery level. </p>

<p>At this level Communications and Operations practices are established and refined. </p>

<details>

<summary>
2.1. Balance Gov, Ops and Comms <em>(Gov)</em></summary>
<p>The board needs to recognize that is has to perform and balance three sorts of activities: governance (Gov), communications (Comms), and operations (Ops), with Governance having an oversight responsibility to ensure Ops and Comms are functioning effectively. </p></details>

<details>

<summary>
2.2. Schedule a Quality Calendar of Events <em>(Ops)</em></summary>
<p>The club needs to have an active and diverse and interesting calendar of events. </p></details>

<details>

<summary>
2.3. Provide Great Event Hosting <em>(Ops)</em></summary>
<p>The events need to be hosted in a friendly, welcoming and inclusive manner. </p></details>

<details>

<summary>
2.4. Communicate with Club Members <em>(Comms)</em></summary>
<p>The club needs to have an effective communications program &#8211; with emails being the core of any such program. </p></details>

<details>

<summary>
2.5. Deliver Successful Events <em>(Ops)</em></summary>
<p>The events need to be successful &#8211; attracting a reasonable number of alumni with diverse demographics, and with attendees going away happy. </p></details>
</details>

<details>

<summary>
3. Pipeline Level <em>(Gov)</em></summary>
<p>The board needs to maintain a roster of active and contributing members.. </p>

<p>This is an advanced Governance level. </p>

<details>

<summary>
3.1. Attract new board members <em>(Gov)</em></summary>
<p>Club members need to feel an attraction towards the current board and the club&#8217;s operations; they need to feel that being involved in the club at that level is fun and rewarding. </p></details>

<details>

<summary>
3.2. Recruit new board members <em>(Gov)</em></summary>
<p>Potential new board members need to be identified and recruited to join the board. </p></details>

<details>

<summary>
3.3. Engage new board members <em>(Gov)</em></summary>
<p>New board members must become engaged in various facets of the club&#8217;s activities. </p></details>
</details>

<details>

<summary>
4. Improvement Level <em>(Gov)</em></summary>
<p>At this level the club is able to maintain a reliable level of baseline services to its members, and is able to improve upon that baseline incrementally. </p>

<p>In order to achieve these goals the club needs to retain and refine its institutional knowledge, and pass this on from one year to the next, and from one generation of leaders to the next. </p>

<p>This is another advanced Governance level. </p>

<details>

<summary>
4.1. Preserve Institutional Knowledge <em>(Gov)</em></summary>
<p>The club&#8217;s institutional knowledge should be documented in some fashion. </p></details>

<details>

<summary>
4.2. Utilize Documented Knowledge <em>(Comms, Gov, Ops)</em></summary>
<p>The documented knowledge can be used on a regular basis by board members, and/or used as part of an onboarding process for new board members. But it should not be allowed to become shelfware (put on the shelf for show but never actually used), nor should it become lostware (as in &#8220;I know we have it somewhere, but I can&#8217;t remember where we put it&#8221;). </p></details>

<details>

<summary>
4.3. Incrementally Improve <em>(Gov)</em></summary>
<p>The board needs to be receptive to new ideas from old and new club members (while remaining cognizant of lessons learned in the past), and needs to enhance its institutional knowledge from time to time. </p></details>
</details>

<details>

<summary>
5. Developmental Level <em>(Gov)</em></summary>
<p>The board needs to develop the capabilities of its members in multiple areas. </p>

<p>This is the most advanced Governance level. </p>

<details>

<summary>
5.1. Develop Knowledge of Mechanics <em>(Gov)</em></summary>
<p>New Board members should be trained in the mechanics of our club&#8217;s functions, including Ops, Comms and some Gov functions. </p></details>

<details>

<summary>
5.2. Develop Teaming Skills <em>(Gov)</em></summary>
<p>Board members should learn how to team effectively with others. </p></details>

<details>

<summary>
5.3. Develop Leadership Skills <em>(Gov)</em></summary>
<p>Board members should be able to develop their leadership capabilities. </p></details>

<details>

<summary>
5.4. Rotate Board Positions Regularly <em>(Gov)</em></summary>
<p>Individual board members should not stay in particular positions for more than three years; rotations should provide developmental opportunities for new board members; board members should not remain on the board for more than six years. </p></details>

<details>

<summary>
5.5. Recognize and Reward Board Members <em>(Gov)</em></summary>
<p>Those leaving the board after multiple years of successful service to the club should receive generous recognition of their contributions and accomplishments. </p></details>

<details>

<summary>
5.6. Maintain Relationships with Former Board Members <em>(Gov)</em></summary>
<p>Relationships should be maintained with those who have served successfully on the board for multiple years; such former board members should be thought of as senior advisers; such advisers should be consulted periodically by the board. </p></details>
