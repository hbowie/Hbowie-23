				<h3>&ldquo;Design is the fundamental soul of a man-made creation&rdquo;</h3>
				
				<p class="tags-align"><a class='tag-link' href='../tags/design.html' rel='tag'>design</a></p>
				
				<blockquote>
					<p>In most people&#8217;s vocabularies, design means veneer. It&#8217;s interior decorating. It&#8217;s the fabric of the curtains and the sofa. But to me, nothing could be further from the meaning of design. Design is the fundamental soul of a man-made creation that ends up expressing itself in successive outer layers of the product or service. </p>

				<h3>&ldquo;The legitimate object of government&rdquo;</h3>
				
				<p class="tags-align"><a class='tag-link' href='../tags/governance.html' rel='tag'>governance</a> <a class='tag-link' href='../tags/society.html' rel='tag'>society</a></p>
				
				<blockquote>
					<p>The legitimate object of government, is to do for a community of people, whatever they need to have done, but can not do, at all, or can not, so well do, for themselves &#8211; in their separate, and individual capacities. In all that the people can individually do as well for themselves, government ought not to interfere. The desirable things which the individuals of a people can not do, or can not well do, for themselves, fall into two classes: those which have relation to wrongs, and those which have not. Each of these branch off into an infinite variety of subdivisions. The first &#8211; that in relation to wrongs &#8211; embraces all crimes, misdemeanors, and nonperformance of contracts. The other embraces all which, in its nature, and without wrong, requires combined action, as public roads and highways, public schools, charities, pauperism, orphanage, estates of the deceased, and the machinery of government itself. From this it appears that if all men were just, there still would be some, though not so much, need for government. </p>

				<h3>&ldquo;The chicken experiment&rdquo;</h3>
				
				<p class="tags-align"><a class='tag-link' href='../tags/evolution.html' rel='tag'>evolution</a> <a class='tag-link' href='../tags/society.html' rel='tag'>society</a></p>
				
				<blockquote>
					<p>But the chicken experiments suggest that this logic is flawed &#8211; even for farm animals where eugenics is a common practice. It seems Francis Galton was deeply mistaken about the relationship between individual abilities and societal welfare. The number of eggs laid by an individual hen is not an individual trait so much as it is a social trait, because it depends upon how members of the group behave towards each other. If the individuals who profit most from a social group do not contribute to the group&#8217;s welfare, and if their traits are heritable, then selecting for them results in the collapse of the society. </p>

				<h3>&ldquo;Three Layers of Tribal Instincts&rdquo;</h3>
				
				<p class="tags-align"></p>
				
				<blockquote>
					<p>In this book, I peel the onion of our special human talent for sharing with groups to distinguish three layers of “tribal instincts.” They originated in the Stone Age, but we can still recognize these evolved systems in our minds and hearts today. Our sideways glances at classmates, coworkers, and neighbors are part of the <em>peer instinct</em>, as is our impulse to mesh with their patterns in our everyday inferences and actions. Our upward-directed fascination with celebrities, CEOs, MVPs, and other elites comes from the <em>hero instinct</em>, as do our aspirations for glory and our drive to contribute. Our backward-gazing nostalgia is part of the <em>ancestor instinct</em>, as is the comfort we find in traditions and the duty we feel to maintain them. These instincts are like three characters inside every person: the conformist who seeks belonging and understanding, the contributor who dreams of esteem and tribute, and the traditionalist who cherishes continuity. Each of these systems has its fallibilities, but—as we’ll see—each generally guides people in adaptive directions. </p>

				<h3>&ldquo;Imagination is not a means of making money&rdquo;</h3>
				
				<p class="tags-align"><a class='tag-link' href='../tags/humanism.html' rel='tag'>humanism</a></p>
				
				<blockquote>
					<p>In America the imagination is generally looked on as something that might be useful when the TV is out of order. Poetry and plays have no relation to practical politics. Novels are for students, housewives, and other people who don&#8217;t work. Fantasy is for children and primitive peoples. Literacy is so you can read the operating instructions. I think the imagination is the single most useful tool mankind possesses. It beats the opposable thumb. I can imagine living without my thumbs, but not without my imagination. </p>

<p>I hear voices agreeing with me. &#8220;Yes, yes!&#8221; they cry. &#8220;The creative imagination is a tremendous plus in business! We value creativity, we reward it!&#8221; In the marketplace, the word creativity has come to mean the generation of ideas applicable to practical strategies to make larger profits. This reduction has gone on so long that the word creative can hardly be degraded further. I don&#8217;t use it any more, yielding it to capitalists and academics to abuse as they like. But they can&#8217;t have imagination. </p>

<p>Imagination is not a means of making money. It has no place in the vocabulary of profit-making. It is not a weapon, though all weapons originate from it, and their use, or non-use, depends on it, as with all tools and their uses. The imagination is an essential tool of the mind, a fundamental way of thinking, an indispensable means of becoming and remaining human. </p>

				<p class="tags-align"><a class='tag-link' href='../tags/connection.html' rel='tag'>connection</a> <a class='tag-link' href='../tags/liberty.html' rel='tag'>liberty</a></p>
				
				<blockquote>
					<p>Swing — the dance and the music — bespeaks the flexible nature of American life. In jazz, the bass walks a note on every beat. The drummer rides the cymbal or plays brushes on every beat. And everybody else invents melodies and sounds that sway with, against, and upside every beat. Every beat requires musicians to reassess their relationships to one another. This is what makes swinging so challenging. You are forced to be constantly aware of other people&#8217;s feelings. </p>
