				<h3>&ldquo;The US remains astonishingly backward when it comes to education&rdquo;</h3>
				
				<p class="tags-align"><a class='tag-link' href='../tags/education.html' rel='tag'>education</a> <a class='tag-link' href='../tags/equality.html' rel='tag'>equality</a></p>
				
				<blockquote>
					<p>It&#8217;s an unfortunate fact that the United States remains astonishingly backward compared to almost all other advanced Western countries when it comes to education, because in America, what predicts how well a child will do in school is not a child&#8217;s aptitude or hard work, but the status of the child&#8217;s parents &#8211; which is to say, their own levels of education and wealth. Other countries suffer from this condition too, but the United States is especially anachronistic. And it&#8217;s getting worse: The influence of this wealth predictor in the United States today has only been growing stronger in recent years. </p>

				<h3>&ldquo;Cultures as a kind of mental infection&rdquo;</h3>
				
				<p class="tags-align"><a class='tag-link' href='../tags/cultural-evolution.html' rel='tag'>cultural evolution</a></p>
				
				<blockquote>
					<p>Ever more scholars see cultures as a kind of mental infection or parasite, with humans as its unwitting host. Organic parasites, such as viruses, live inside the body of their hosts. They multiply and spread from one host to the other, feeding off their hosts, weakening them, and sometimes even killing them. As long as the hosts live long enough to pass along the parasite, it cares little about the condition of its host. In just this fashion, cultural ideas live inside the minds of humans. They multiply and spread from one host to another, occasionally weakening the hosts and sometimes even killing them. A cultural idea &#8211; such as belief in Christian heaven above the clouds or Communist paradise here on earth &#8211; can compel a human to dedicate his or her life to spreading that idea, even at the price of death. The human dies, but the idea spreads. According to this approach, cultures are not conspiracies concocted by some people in order to take advantage of others (as Marxists tend to think). Rather, cultures are mental parasites that emerge accidentally, and thereafter take advantage of all people infected by them. </p>

				<h3>&ldquo;the biological evolution of Homo sapiens was usurped by socio-cultural evolution&rdquo;</h3>
				
				<p class="tags-align"><a class='tag-link' href='../tags/cultural-evolution.html' rel='tag'>cultural evolution</a></p>
				
				<blockquote>
					<p>Many biologists and social scientists have noted that with the development of human culture, the biological evolution of Homo sapiens was usurped by socio-cultural evolution. The construction of artificial environments and social structures created new criteria for selection, and biological fitness was replaced by &#8216;cultural fitness&#8217;, which is often different for different cultures and is generally not measured by the number of offspring. Moreover, the mechanism of socio-cultural evolution is different from the model of biological evolution that was proposed by Charles Darwin (1809–1882), and refined by many others. In essence, socio-cultural evolution is &#8216;Lamarckian&#8217; in nature &#8211; it is an example of acquired inheritance, as described by the French naturalist Jean-Baptiste Lamarck (1744–1829) &#8211; because humans are able to pass on cultural achievements to the next generation. </p>

Every man, when he gets quiet, when he becomes desperately honest with himself, is capable of uttering profound truths. We all derive from the same source. there is no mystery about the origin of things. We are all part of creation, all kings, all poets, all musicians; we have only to open up, only to discover what is already there. </p>

				<blockquote>
					<p>The existence and validity of human rights are not written in the stars. The ideals concerning the conduct of men toward each other and the desirable structure of the community have been conceived and taught by enlightened individuals in the course of history. Those ideals and convictions which resulted from historical experience, from the craving for beauty and harmony, have been readily accepted in theory by man &#8211; and at all times, have been trampled upon by the same people under the pressure of their animal instincts. A large part of history is therefore replete with the struggle for those human rights, an eternal struggle in which a final victory can never be won. But to tire in that struggle would mean the ruin of society. </p>

				<blockquote>
					<p>The legitimate object of government, is to do for a community of people, whatever they need to have done, but can not do, at all, or can not, so well do, for themselves &#8211; in their separate, and individual capacities. In all that the people can individually do as well for themselves, government ought not to interfere. The desirable things which the individuals of a people can not do, or can not well do, for themselves, fall into two classes: those which have relation to wrongs, and those which have not. Each of these branch off into an infinite variety of subdivisions. The first &#8211; that in relation to wrongs &#8211; embraces all crimes, misdemeanors, and nonperformance of contracts. The other embraces all which, in its nature, and without wrong, requires combined action, as public roads and highways, public schools, charities, pauperism, orphanage, estates of the deceased, and the machinery of government itself. From this it appears that if all men were just, there still would be some, though not so much, need for government. </p>

					<p>But the chicken experiments suggest that this logic is flawed &#8211; even for farm animals where eugenics is a common practice. It seems Francis Galton was deeply mistaken about the relationship between individual abilities and societal welfare. The number of eggs laid by an individual hen is not an individual trait so much as it is a social trait, because it depends upon how members of the group behave towards each other. If the individuals who profit most from a social group do not contribute to the group&#8217;s welfare, and if their traits are heritable, then selecting for them results in the collapse of the society. </p>
