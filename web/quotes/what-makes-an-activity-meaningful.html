				<h3>&ldquo;What makes an activity meaningful?&rdquo;</h3>

				<p class="tags-align"><a class='tag-link' href='../tags/meaning.html' rel='tag'>meaning</a></p>

				<blockquote>
					<p>A meaningful activity is oriented toward a goal, one that, if accomplished, would have an impact on the world &#8211; and this usually means that it has an impact on other people. This activity&#8230; has some structure &#8211; it&#8217;s the sort of thing that one can tell a story about, It connects to&#8230; spirituality and often connects to flow (leading to experience of self loss) and often brings you into close contact with other people and is often seen as morally virtuous. </p>
