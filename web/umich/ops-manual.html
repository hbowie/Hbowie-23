U-M Club of Seattle Operations Manual</summary>
<p>&#8211; Draft &#8211; </p>

<p>Written by Herb Bowie </p>

<p>Dated Oct 4, 2023 </p>

<details>

<summary>
1 Introduction</summary>
<p>This document is intended to define roles, responsibilities and operating procedures for the University of Michigan Club of Seattle, hereinafter referred to as the &#8220;Club&#8221;. </p>

<p>This manual operates within the constraints established by the <a href="https://alumni.umich.edu/communities-clubs/umseattle/bylaws/" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Club Bylaws</a>. </p></details>

<details>

<summary>
2 Status</summary>
<p>The University of Michigan Club of Seattle is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/501(c)(3)_organization" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">501(c)(3)</a> nonprofit <a href="https://ccfs.sos.wa.gov/#/BusinessSearch/BusinessInformation" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">incorporated in the State of Washington</a>, and an affiliate of the <a href="http://alumni.umich.edu" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alumni Association of the University of Michigan</a>. </p>

<p>Washington State has assigned the Club the Unified Business Identifier (UBI) number of 604 115 028. </p></details>

<details>

<summary>
3 Purpose</summary>
<p>As stated in the Club Bylaws: </p>

<blockquote>

<p>The Club is an affiliate of, and chartered by, the Alumni Association of the University of Michigan (hereinafter, “AAUM”), an educational, nonprofit membership organization of graduates and friends of the University of Michigan (hereinafter, “U-M”). The Club and AAUM bring alumni together in support of each other and to promote the objectives of the University of Michigan through the establishment and maintenance of contact among the University, its graduates, and present and prospective students. Additionally, the Club encourages and supports the matriculation of local students at the University of Michigan through the administration and continued development of the Roby Burley Scholarship fund. </p>
</blockquote>
</details>

<details>

<summary>
4 Related Organizations</summary>
<p>It is important to keep in mind a few organizational distinctions. </p>

<p>Our local Club is an affiliate of the Alumni Association of the University of Michigan (AAUM), and is chartered by the AAUM, but is a separate organization from the AAUM, in terms of both legal and financial considerations. </p>

<p>Our Club is a  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/501(c)(3)_organization" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">501(c)(3)</a> nonprofit organization incorporated in the state of Washington in 2017. </p>

<p>The AAUM is a nonprofit membership organization founded in 1854 and incorporated in 1897. It is tax-exempt under section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code. </p>

<p>Though a committed partner of the University of Michigan (U-M), the AAUM is an independent organization and receives no funding from the University. Its primary source of funding is membership dues. And the AAUM, in turn, is the primary source of funcing for our club. </p>

<p>As leaders of a regional club, we generally work supportively with all members of the greater University of Michigan community, including collaboration with development personnel from AAUM, U-M and from the individual schools within the University. </p>

<p>We also occasionally collaborate with the Michigan Ross Alumni Club of Seattle, which is yet another organization that is separate from our Club. </p></details>
