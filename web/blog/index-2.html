				<p>First book I&#8217;ve read by this author. A sort of origin story for a British spy starting to work in the early sixties. Seems to be the start of a planned series. Well written, thoroughly engaging. Lots of interesting historical references. If this book brings something new to the genre, then I suppose it would be the provision of a convincing back story for why and how a young man would become involved in such an activity, and what sort of young man that might be. </p>

				<p>An interesting read. Would have been even more interesting if I were British and reading it when it first came out. A bit of a mystery and a bit of a horror story, and also a political satire. </p>

				</h3>
				

				<p>Turns out there was a fatal bug in 17.4.0, which caused Notenik to crash when creating a new collection (or opening any collection containing only one note). </p>

<p>This turned out to be a rookie coding error — trying to access the first item in a list with a subscript of 1, instead of a subscript of 0. </p>

<p>I can&#8217;t believe I coded this, and imagine it was an XCode &#8220;hallucination&#8221; that I let slip by my fingers without correction. </p>

<p>XCode&#8217;s &#8220;suggestions&#8221; are often helpful, but this is a bit of a red flag for me. </p>

<p>I&#8217;ll have to be more careful and intentional in the future. </p>

						Blog Creation

				<p>Starting work on this new blog. This is as much for myself, as for anyone else (although I do plan to publish it on the web, and vis RSS). </p>

<p>I&#8217;ve realized recently that I&#8217;ve been too much constrained by other people&#8217;s ideas of what such a thing should look like. </p>

<p>So my starting point is to create a new Notenik collection for myself, to keep track of ideas/achievements and so on. </p>

<p>If other people are interested in following and/or commenting, then that is fine. But my goal here is first and foremost to create something for myself, not to attract followers. </p>

<p>Also note that I am backfilling some content relating to past accomplishments, and not just starting at this point and moving forward. </p>

				<p>I thought this was a fantastic read, mixing together social commentary, murder mystery plus insights on the rationale for storytelling, as well as demonstrating the effects of different sorts of narrative styles. And Coe manages to juggle all of these different interests while still delivering a darned good story. Also of note: Coe does a good job of broadening his social commentary to include American as as well as British readers, so one need not be an expert on British politics to follow along. </p>

				<p>I still remember the first time we laid eyes on Hank. It was a sunny day in May, and we met him and his current owner in a park somewhere nearby, on neutral territory. And then, when we saw Hank, I quickly realized the gravity of the decision we were about to make. Because Hank was tail-waggingly perfect. So there was no question of passing on him, and holding out for a <em>better</em> dog. Because I couldn’t imagine what a better dog would look like. </p>

				<p>There’s been a lot of discussion lately about AI, and Apple’s AI problems in particular, and I have some potentially useful, and perhaps even original, thoughts on these subjects.

				<p>This is a bracing little read. Lots of writers these days toss around the possibility of some alternative to capitalism being a preferable economic model without indulging in very many specifics about how such a thing would work, or how such a change would come about. The author here takes a somewhat rigorous (and mercifully brief) approach to examining various alternatives, and concludes that most of these won&#8217;t hold water, and finally lands on a degrowth/steady state economy as our necessary future.  <br />
