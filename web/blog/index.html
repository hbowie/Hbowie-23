				<p>Finished watching the PBS Masterpiece Mystery series season 6 of Unforgotten, and it was really good. I&#8217;ve watched lots of Masterpiece Mystery shows and similar fare, and after a while they seem to lean more into the appeal of their folksy detectives, and away from their plots and characters. This series went completely in the opposite direction. So many rich characters, and so much great acting, and so many interesting stories within the story! And very contemporary and topical, in interesting and unexpected ways. Good stuff! </p>

				<p>I enjoyed this. Spike Lee&#8217;s direction seems to do a good job of translating the stage production to film, without any obtrusive directorial flourishes. It&#8217;s a good mix of music, and it&#8217;s remarkable to see the barefoot musicans also performing as dancers, aided by technology that allows them to flow around the stage and around each other without any wires. It&#8217;s a moving display of the ability of humans to remain connected to one another, in terms of music and dance and mood and intention, despite their distinctively individual roles and abilities and appearances. The overall theme of connection reminded me a bit of this quote from Ross MacDonald: </p>

<blockquote>

<p>I had to admit to myself that I lived for nights like these, moving across the city’s great broken body, making connections among its millions of cells. I had a crazy wish or fantasy that some day before I died, if I made all the right neural connections, the city would come all the way alive. Like the Bride of Frankenstein. </p>
</blockquote>

				<p>I really enjoyed this film. There are just so many interesting facets to it. Denzel Washington is so entertaining, and completely inhabits his role. Dean Winter — the actor who plays the chaos agent  in the Allstate &#8220;mayhem&#8221; commercials — plays a white detective, and gets to reprise that role when he is plowing his police car through a crowd while in pursuit of a suspect. (References to &#8220;mayhem&#8221; are also amusingly dropped into the script from time to time.) The film is part crime film, part action film, but ultimately is a meditation on what matters most in our lives, and how we have to let go of some things, and risk losing others, in order to keep the things that are most important. </p>

						<p>Finished reading <em>Marble Hall Murders</em> by Anthony Horowitz </p>

				<p>This is the third book in the Magpie Murders series, and was an enjoyable read. But the author is a screenwriter as well as a book writer, and the first two books were made into very successful TV shows, and this third book feels a little more like a warmup for the TV script than a book that needed to be written for its own sake. The novelty to the series is that there are parallel mysteries unfolding — one in a partially finished novel by a character within the story, and one happening with the story&#8217;s author and her editor and their associates. What proved a bit disappointing to me in this book was that the detective in the outside story was so completely isolated. Would have helped me if she had had some kind of faithful sidekick or companion.  <br />
