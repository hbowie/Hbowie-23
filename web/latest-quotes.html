				<h3>&ldquo;The conquest of nature&rdquo;</h3>

				<p class="tags-align"></p>

				<blockquote>
					<p>Man has long talked somewhat arrogantly about the conquest of nature; now he has the power to achieve his boast. It is our misfortune &#8211; it may well be our final tragedy &#8211; that this power has not been tempered with wisdom, but has been marked by irresponsibility; that there is all too little awareness that man is part of nature, and that the price of conquest may well be the destruction of man himself. </p>

				<h3>&ldquo;Moving across the city's great broken body&rdquo;</h3>

				<p class="tags-align"><a class='tag-link' href='tags/connection.html' rel='tag'>connection</a></p>

				<blockquote>
					<p>I had to admit to myself that I lived for nights like these, moving across the city&#8217;s great broken body, making connections among its millions of cells. I had a crazy wish or fantasy that some day before I died, if I made all the right neural connections, the citty would come all the way alive. Like the Bride of Frankenstein. </p>

				<h3>&ldquo;We must discover wisdom for ourselves&rdquo;</h3>

				<p class="tags-align"><a class='tag-link' href='tags/wisdom.html' rel='tag'>wisdom</a></p>

				<blockquote>
					<p>We do not receive wisdom, we must discover it for ourselves, after a journey through the wilderness, which no one else can make for us, which no one can spare us, for our wisdom is the point of view from which we come at last to regard the world. </p>

				<h3>&ldquo;We are here on Earth to fart around&rdquo;</h3>

				<p class="tags-align"><a class='tag-link' href='tags/meaning.html' rel='tag'>meaning</a></p>

				<blockquote>
					<p>I work at home, and if I wanted to, I could have a computer right by my bed, and I’d never have to leave it. But I use a typewriter, and afterward I mark up the pages with a pencil. Then I call up this woman named Carol out in Woodstock and say, “Are you still doing typing?” Sure she is, and her husband is trying to track bluebirds out there and not having much luck, and so we chitchat back and forth, and I say, “Okay, I’ll send you the pages.” </p>

<p>Then I go down the steps and my wife calls, “Where are you going?” “Well,” I say, “I’m going to buy an envelope.” And she says, “You’re not a poor man. Why don’t you buy a thousand envelopes? They’ll deliver them, and you can put them in the closet.” And I say, “Hush.” </p>

<p>So I go to this newsstand across the street where they sell magazines and lottery tickets and stationery. I have to get in line because there are people buying candy and all that sort of thing, and I talk to them. The woman behind the counter has a jewel between her eyes, and when it’s my turn, I ask her if there have been any big winners lately. </p>

<p>I get my envelope and seal it up and go to the postal convenience center down the block at the corner of Forty-seventh Street and Second Avenue, where I’m secretly in love with the woman behind the counter. I keep absolutely poker-faced; I never let her know how I feel about her. One time I had my pocket picked in there and got to meet a cop and tell him about it. </p>

<p>Anyway, I address the envelope to Carol in Woodstock. I stamp the envelope and mail it in a mailbox in front of the post office, and I go home. </p>

<p>And I’ve had a hell of a good time. I tell you, we are here on Earth to fart around, and don’t let anybody tell you any different. </p>

				<h3>&ldquo;The heart of liberty&rdquo;</h3>

				<h3>&ldquo;Reversible vs. Irreversible Decisions&rdquo;</h3>

				<p class="tags-align"><a class='tag-link' href='tags/critical-thinking.html' rel='tag'>critical thinking</a></p>

				<blockquote>
					<p>Some decisions are consequential and irreversible or nearly irreversible – one-way doors – and these decisions must be made methodically, carefully, slowly, with great deliberation and consultation. If you walk through and don’t like what you see on the other side, you can’t get back to where you were before. We can call these Type 1 decisions. But most decisions aren’t like that – they are changeable, reversible – they’re two-way doors. If you’ve made a suboptimal Type 2 decision, you don’t have to live with the consequences for that long. You can reopen the door and go back through. Type 2 decisions can and should be made quickly by high judgment individuals or small groups. </p>

<p>As organizations get larger, there seems to be a tendency to use the heavy-weight Type 1 decision-making process on most decisions, including many Type 2 decisions. The end result of this is slowness, unthoughtful risk aversion, failure to experiment sufficiently, and consequently diminished invention. We’ll have to figure out how to fight that tendency. </p>

				<h3>&ldquo;Sacred values&rdquo;</h3>

				<p class="tags-align"><a class='tag-link' href='tags/connection.html' rel='tag'>connection</a></p>

				<blockquote>
					<p>Sacred values differ from material or instrumental values in that they incorporate moral beliefs, such as the welfare of family, commitment to country, or identification with a particular religion that is thought to be absolute and inviolable. Sharing of these stories demonstrates honest reliable signals that an individual values the group and its goals. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, the sharing of these sacred values is essential to the formation and maintenance of group identity. </p>

				<h3>&ldquo;A tribe is a creed&rdquo;</h3>

				<p class="tags-align"><a class='tag-link' href='tags/connection.html' rel='tag'>connection</a></p>

				<blockquote>
					<p>A tribe is not a race, or even a population&#8230; a tribe is a creed; it is a team that has agreed upon a set of symbols &#8211; including sacred values &#8211; that identify membership. A creed is a mechanism that glues together disparate small camps and bands of cohabitating humans into a singular identity and shared purpose. Those who know the codes have in their possession a social passport. </p>

				<blockquote>
					<p>What’s good about an individual human life can’t be boiled down to any single value. It’s not all about beauty or all about justice or all about happiness. Pluralist theories are more plausible, postulating a variety of relevant values, including human well-being, justice, fairness, beauty, the artistic peaks of human achievement, the quality of mercy, and the many different and, indeed, sometimes contrasting kinds of happiness. Life is complicated! </p>

				<h3>&ldquo;Meaningful Activities&rdquo;</h3>

				<p class="tags-align"><a class='tag-link' href='tags/meaning.html' rel='tag'>meaning</a></p>

				<blockquote>
					<p>A meaningful activity is oriented toward a goal, one that, if accomplished, would have an impact on the world—and this usually means that it has an impact on other people. This activity extends across a significant portion of one’s life and has some structure—it’s the sort of thing that one can tell a story about. It often connects to religion and spirituality and often connects to flow (leading to the experience of self-loss) and often brings you into close contact with other people and is often seen as morally virtuous—but none of these additional features are essential. </p>
