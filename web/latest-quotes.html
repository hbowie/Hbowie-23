				<h3>&ldquo;Human life is complicated&rdquo;</h3>

				<p class="tags-align"><a class='tag-link' href='tags/meaning.html' rel='tag'>meaning</a></p>

				<blockquote>
					<p>What’s good about an individual human life can’t be boiled down to any single value. It’s not all about beauty or all about justice or all about happiness. Pluralist theories are more plausible, postulating a variety of relevant values, including human well-being, justice, fairness, beauty, the artistic peaks of human achievement, the quality of mercy, and the many different and, indeed, sometimes contrasting kinds of happiness. Life is complicated! </p>
				</blockquote>

				<h3>&ldquo;Before I started school striking&rdquo;</h3>

				<p class="tags-align"><a class='tag-link' href='tags/meaning.html' rel='tag'>meaning</a></p>

				<blockquote>
					<p>Before I started school striking I had no energy, no friends and I didn’t speak to anyone. I just sat alone at home, with an eating disorder. All of that is gone now, since I have found a meaning, in a world that sometimes seems shallow and meaningless to so many people. </p>

				<h3>&ldquo;The Social Suite&rdquo;</h3>

				<p class="tags-align"><a class='tag-link' href='tags/society.html' rel='tag'>society</a></p>

				<blockquote>
					<p>At the core of all societies, I will show, is the social suite: </p>
<ol>
<li>The capacity to have and recognize individual identity </li>
<li>Love for partners and offspring </li>
<li>Friendship </li>
<li>Social networks </li>
<li>Cooperation </li>
<li>Preference for one’s own group (that is, “in-group bias”) </li>
<li>Mild hierarchy (that is, relative egalitarianism) </li>
<li>Social learning and teaching </li>
</ol>

				<h3>&ldquo;Meaningful Activities&rdquo;</h3>

				<p class="tags-align"><a class='tag-link' href='tags/meaning.html' rel='tag'>meaning</a></p>

				<blockquote>
					<p>A meaningful activity is oriented toward a goal, one that, if accomplished, would have an impact on the world—and this usually means that it has an impact on other people. This activity extends across a significant portion of one’s life and has some structure—it’s the sort of thing that one can tell a story about. It often connects to religion and spirituality and often connects to flow (leading to the experience of self-loss) and often brings you into close contact with other people and is often seen as morally virtuous—but none of these additional features are essential. </p>

				<h3>&ldquo;The Tribe Drive&rdquo;</h3>

				<p class="tags-align"><a class='tag-link' href='tags/connection.html' rel='tag'>connection</a></p>

				<blockquote>
					<p>The &#8220;Tribe Drive&#8221; is an ancient adaptation that has been a prerequisite for survival for 99.9 percent of our species&#8217; evolutionary history. It is a critical piece of cognitive machinery &#8211; honed by millions of years of evolution &#8211; that gave us the ability to navigate, both cooperatively and competitively, increasingly complex social landscapes. </p>

				<h3>&ldquo;A raving demagogue counseling hatred&rdquo;</h3>

				<blockquote>
					<p>So next time you hear a raving demagogue counseling hatred for other, slightly different groups of humans, for a moment at least see if you can understand his problem: He is heeding an ancient call that &#8211; however dangerous, obsolete, and maladaptive it may be today &#8211; once benefitted our species. </p>

				<blockquote>
					<p>Education demands a certain daring, a certain independence of mind. We have to teach young people to think. And to teach young people, in order to teach young people to think, you have to teach them to think about everything. There mustn&#8217;t be something they cannot think about. If there&#8217;s something, if there&#8217;s one thing they can&#8217;t think about, then very shortly they can&#8217;t think about anything, you know. Now, there&#8217;s always something in this country, of course, one cannot think about. </p>

I think, a lot of times, that gets lost, when people talk about me in particular: Oh, you guys don’t sing the anthem, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. You don’t love America. But we do love America. It’s just more in a James Baldwin kind of way, not in a bald-eagle-on-your-shoulder kind of way. </p>

				<h3>&ldquo;Paradoxes rationally serve as tribal loyalty tests&rdquo;</h3>

				<p class="tags-align"><a class='tag-link' href='tags/society.html' rel='tag'>society</a></p>

				<blockquote>
					<p>Anthropologist Claude Levi-Strauss made the argument that the purpose of mythology is to create paradoxes (for example, the Holy Ghost is a paradoxical trinity where God the father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit are one and the same). It is a mystery that must be believed nevertheless. Paradoxes rationally serve as tribal loyalty tests because the more logic-defying the premise, the stronger the tribal signal. </p>

				<h3>&ldquo;The encoding of the Tribe Drive in our DNA&rdquo;</h3>

				<p class="tags-align"><a class='tag-link' href='tags/connection.html' rel='tag'>connection</a></p>

				<blockquote>
					<p>As we explore the natural history of tribalism, we will see that some three hundred thousand years ago humans chanced upon a revolutionary adaptation that led to the encoding of the Tribe Drive in our DNA. This was the evolution of nested groups, each with their own particular symbols &#8211; and enshrined shared myths and values &#8211; that bound participants together in trusting relationships. </p>

				<blockquote>
					<p>If you&#8217;re picking colors based on a Pantone book, you&#8217;re limited to a certain number of choices. If you step out in nature, the palette is infinite. Each rock has such a variation of color within it, we could never find a can of paint to mimic the exact same shade. </p>

<p>Nature transcends our tendencies to label and classify, to reduce and limit. The natural world is unfathomably more rich, interwoven, and complicated than we are taught, and so much more mysterious and beautiful. </p>

				<h3>&ldquo;Notation not to be confused with music itself&rdquo;</h3>

				<p class="tags-align"><a class='tag-link' href='tags/art.html' rel='tag'>art</a> <a class='tag-link' href='tags/music.html' rel='tag'>music</a></p>

				<blockquote>
					<p>Essentially then notation is a convention by which the general proportions of a composition may be roughly described. It is not to be confused with music itself. It is merely the blue-print from which music may be constructed. It has its advantages as an expedient for the preservation of the structural ideas of composers and as an aid in the manipulation of musical proportions; but music itself remains a transient experience of ephemeral designs in values of time, a process of change in which each element passes from the future into the past, dying at the instant of its birth, tangible only as a momentary oscillation of air particles. </p>

<p>If I seem to digress here into the general field of musical aesthetics, it is only because these discrepancies are so often ignored by writers on music as to constitute a continual source of muddlement. </p>

				<blockquote>
					<p>And it was true, the religion she was raised in had always seemed vaguely foolish to her, if rich with mystery and ceremony, for why should babies be born into sin, why should she pray to the invisible forces, why would god be a trinity, why should she, who felt her greatness hot in her blood, be considered lesser because the first woman was molded from a rib and ate a fruit and thus lost lazy Eden? It was senseless. Her faith had twisted very early in her childhood; it would slowly grow ever more bent into its geometry until it was its own angular, majestic thing. </p>
