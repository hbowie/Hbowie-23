				<h3>&ldquo;American decline&rdquo;</h3>

				<p class="tags-align"><a class='tag-link' href='tags/usa.html' rel='tag'>USA</a></p>

				<blockquote>
					<p>Not only did tarnish appear on our image of American virtue, not only did disillusion occur when the hypocrisy of American ideals was discovered, but we began to sense that what we had originally seen as the American Golden Age was actually the decline of an era. The worldwide outbreak of revolution against colonialism and imperialism, the entrenchment of totalitarian states, the menace of war, overpopulation, international disorder, supertechnology &#8211; these trends were testing the tenacity of our own commitment to democracy and freedom and our abilities to visualize their application to a world in upheaval. </p>

				<h3>&ldquo;We may be the last generation in the experiment with living&rdquo;</h3>

				<p class="tags-align"><a class='tag-link' href='tags/governance.html' rel='tag'>governance</a> <a class='tag-link' href='tags/sustainability.html' rel='tag'>sustainability</a></p>

				<blockquote>
					<p>Our work is guided by the sense that we may be the last generation in the experiment with living. But we are a minority &#8211; the vast majority of our people regard the temporary equilibriums of our society and world as eternally functional parts. In this is perhaps the outstanding paradox; we ourselves are imbued with urgency, yet the message of our society is that there is no viable alternative to the present. Beneath the reassuring tones of the politicians, beneath the common opinion that America will &#8220;muddle through,&#8221; beneath the stagnation of those who have closed their minds to the future, is the pervading feeling that there simply are no alternatives, that our times have witnessed the exhaustion not only of Utopias, but of any new departures as well. Feeling the press of complexity upon the emptiness of life, people are fearful of the thought that at any moment things might be thrust out of control. They fear change itself, since change might smash whatever invisible framework seems to hold back chaos for them now. For most Americans, all crusades are suspect, threatening. The fact that each individual sees apathy in his fellows perpetuates the common reluctance to organize for change. The dominant institutions are complex enough to blunt the minds of their potential critics, and entrenched enough to swiftly dissipate or entirely repel the energies of protest and reform, thus limiting human expectancies. Then, too, we are a materially improved society, and by our own improvements we seem to have weakened the case for further change. </p>

				<h3>&ldquo;Mankind desperately needs revolutionary leadership&rdquo;</h3>

				<p class="tags-align"><a class='tag-link' href='tags/governance.html' rel='tag'>governance</a></p>

				<blockquote>
					<p>Although our own technology is destroying old and creating new forms of social organization, men still tolerate meaningless work and idleness. While two-thirds of mankind suffers under nourishment, our own upper classes revel amidst superfluous abundance. Although world population is expected to double in forty years, the nations still tolerate anarchy as a major principle of international conduct and uncontrolled exploitation governs the sapping of the earth&#8217;s physical resources. Although mankind desperately needs revolutionary leadership, America rests in national stalemate, its goals ambiguous and tradition-bound instead of informed and clear, its democratic system apathetic and manipulated rather than &#8220;of, by, and for the people.&#8221; </p>

				<blockquote>

Now it seemed as if the only task that meant anything was search-engine optimization. </p>

				<p class="tags-align"><a class='tag-link' href='tags/nature.html' rel='tag'>nature</a> <a class='tag-link' href='tags/wonder.html' rel='tag'>wonder</a></p>

				<blockquote>
					<p>Down in the meadow by the river rapids, by the tumble of wet boulders, a large woodpecker was drumming on a hollow tree. A buzzard eagle soared past the vertical face of a red pinnacle. Warm late-morning air currents were stirring the woods along the road, creating a tapestry of light and shadow so fine-grained and chaotic in its shiftings that no computer on earth could have modeled it. Nature even on the most local of scales made a mockery of information technology. Even augmented by tech, the human brain was paltry, infinitesimal, in comparison to the universe. </p>

				<h3>&ldquo;Always difficult decisions needing to be made&rdquo;</h3>

				<p class="tags-align"><a class='tag-link' href='tags/governance.html' rel='tag'>governance</a></p>

				<blockquote>
					<p>Human affairs were so messy. You could do your best to lead a quiet life, to keep out of unnecessary conflict, to put in your forty years or whatever it was of working to the best of your ability without creating too many ripples, but there were always difficult decisions needing to be made . And however hard you tried, there would be times when you could not avoid causing pain to others, because pain and disappointment seemed an inevitable concomitant of human life. The moment you accepted any promotion, any slight advantage over those below you in the pecking order, you had to accept that you might have to do things that others would prefer you not to do — make rulings that would dash the hopes of others, give one person advantage over another, make people do things they would rather not do. All this came with seniority; all this came with working in a hierarchical organization; all this came with simply being human. </p>

				<h3>&ldquo;The main cause of capitalism's problems is overpopulation&rdquo;</h3>

				<p class="tags-align"><a class='tag-link' href='tags/sustainability.html' rel='tag'>sustainability</a></p>

				<blockquote>
					<p>Despite its successes, and perhaps because of them, capitalism created, or could not prevent the creation of, the two problems that now threaten its survival: enormous economic inequalities both between and within countries, and the largely worsening if not the destruction of the natural environment. As we have analyzed in a previous chapter, the main cause of these problems is overpopulation in relation to the resources provided by the Earth. </p>

				<h3>&ldquo;You create a world of your own&rdquo;</h3>

				<p class="tags-align"></p>

				<blockquote>
					<p>In 1983, when he [Ken Thompson] and [Dennis] Richie won the Turing award, which has been called the Nobel prize of computer science, Thompson explained, “I am a programmer. On my 1040 form, that is what I put down as my occupation.” He has called programming an addiction of sorts, and it was in the Berkeley computer center that he got hooked. Sitting in the Bell Labs offices years later, he described the appeal as having all the craftsman’s satisfactions of making things, without the cost and trouble of procuring the materials. “It’s like building something where you don’t have to order the cement,” Thompson said. “You create a world of your own, your own environment, and you never leave this room.” </p>

				<blockquote>
					<p>It&#8217;s all the reasons why human psychology will never be fully explained or pictured by scientific investigation — there are just too many variables, too many vectors pressing in on every incident. It&#8217;s the reason why storytelling and songwriting and poetry-making will always be so much more effective organizers and vehicles of our experience than studies in social science. </p>

					<p>The incidence of play is not associated with any particular stage of civilization or view of the universe. Any thinking person can see at a glance that play is a thing on its own, even if his language possesses no general concept to express it. Play cannot be denied. You can deny, if you like, nearly all abstractions: justice, beauty, truth, goodness, mind, God. You can deny seriousness, but not play. </p>

				<h3>&ldquo;Our tribal instincts are not bugs&rdquo;</h3>

				<p class="tags-align"><a class='tag-link' href='tags/evolution.html' rel='tag'>evolution</a> <a class='tag-link' href='tags/society.html' rel='tag'>society</a></p>

				<blockquote>
					<p>Especially in a time of powerful and shifting politics, we shouldn’t ignore our quintessential human capacities to bond with our communities. Nor should we delude ourselves that the thin gruel of rationality and universalism will mobilize people to accomplish desired goals. </p>

<p>I write as a convert to the advocacy of tribalism. I used to consider group-related instincts as a detrimental force in human affairs. I was raised (as you may have been too) to see rationality, creativity, and morality as the hallmarks of humanity, and I viewed conformity, status-seeking, and traditionalism as fallibilities. But based on what I’ve learned from decades as a behavioral scientist, I’ve come to see my former humanities worldview as naive, or at least incomplete. Our tribal instincts are not bugs in the system that hinder an otherwise intelligent species. They are the distinguishing features of our kind that enabled its evolutionary ascent—and still drive many of its greatest achievements today. They are not human foibles that hold us back; they are human superpowers that create our distinctive cultures. </p>

				<h3>&ldquo;Tribal living is what made us truly human&rdquo;</h3>

				<p class="tags-align"></p>

				<blockquote>
					<p>In <em>Tribal</em>, I hope to reclaim the original meaning of the word as community enabled by shared culture. This is how humankind first transcended the narrow bonds of kith and kin to accomplish bigger things in clans. And it’s how we later ventured into exchange and collaboration with strangers in the broader networks called “tribes.” In these nested groups, our forebears first felt the empowering experience of access to myriad individuals and ideas, the ongoing experiment that we call society. It was an engine for group change and differentiation. By showing that tribal living is the source of cultural change and progress, I hope to put to rest any lingering association of tribes with stasis and primitivism. Tribal living is what made us truly human. </p>

				<h3>&ldquo;Cultural complexity began to expand exponentially&rdquo;</h3>

				<p class="tags-align"></p>

				<blockquote>
					<p>Once all three tribal instincts [the <em>peer</em> instinct, the <em>hero</em> instinct, and the <em>ancestor</em> instinct] were in place, in the last hundred thousand years, our forebears began to thrive and to live in recognizably human ways. Within an evolutionary eyeblink, they suddenly had much more sophisticated tools, weapons, arts, and rituals. After millions of years of achingly slow change, cultural complexity began to expand exponentially. The pools of shared knowledge in human communities began to accumulate across generations and adapt to local ecologies. This tribe-level learning (not heightened individual brainpower) is the secret to how our kind adapted to widely differing climates and terrains. Humans became the earth’s dominant species, threatened only by our own success. </p>

				<h3>&ldquo;Three Layers of Tribal Instincts&rdquo;</h3>

				<p class="tags-align"></p>

				<blockquote>
					<p>In this book, I peel the onion of our special human talent for sharing with groups to distinguish three layers of “tribal instincts.” They originated in the Stone Age, but we can still recognize these evolved systems in our minds and hearts today. Our sideways glances at classmates, coworkers, and neighbors are part of the <em>peer instinct</em>, as is our impulse to mesh with their patterns in our everyday inferences and actions. Our upward-directed fascination with celebrities, CEOs, MVPs, and other elites comes from the <em>hero instinct</em>, as do our aspirations for glory and our drive to contribute. Our backward-gazing nostalgia is part of the <em>ancestor instinct</em>, as is the comfort we find in traditions and the duty we feel to maintain them. These instincts are like three characters inside every person: the conformist who seeks belonging and understanding, the contributor who dreams of esteem and tribute, and the traditionalist who cherishes continuity. Each of these systems has its fallibilities, but—as we’ll see—each generally guides people in adaptive directions. </p>
