				<h3>&ldquo;Engineer and designer need to party together&rdquo;</h3>

				<p class="tags-align"><a class='tag-link' href='tags/design.html' rel='tag'>design</a> <a class='tag-link' href='tags/teams.html' rel='tag'>teams</a> <a class='tag-link' href='tags/technology.html' rel='tag'>technology</a></p>

				<blockquote>
					<p>Prior to Steve Jobs’ return to Apple, there was a decent centralized usability team equipped with those fancy rooms with one-way mirrors and video cameras. I’m certain these folks did significant work, but when Jobs returned, he shut it down and he cast the design teams to the wind. Each product team inherited part of the former usability team. </p>

<p>Now, I arrived after this reorganization occurred, so I don’t know the actual reasoning, but I do know I never saw those usability labs used once and I would argue that in the past decade Apple has created some of the most usable products out there. My opinion is that the choice to spread the usability design function across the engineering team was intended to send a clear message: engineer and designer need to party more… together. </p>

<p>I can’t imagine building a team responsible for consumer products where engineers and designers weren’t constantly meddling in each other’s business. Yes, they often argue from completely opposite sides of the brain. Yes, it is often a battle of art and science, but engineering and design want exactly the same thing. They want the intense satisfaction of knowing they successfully built something that matters. </p>

				<h3>&ldquo;We are innately equipped to cooperate&rdquo;</h3>

				<p class="tags-align"></p>

				<blockquote>
					<p>Living socially places special demands on us, and many cognitive capacities and behavioral repertoires evolved in order for us to cope. For example, we are innately equipped to cooperate, and living in cooperative groups favors certain genetic predispositions related to kindness and reciprocity. </p>

				<h3>&ldquo;You can't dance cheerfully&rdquo;</h3>

				<p class="tags-align"><a class='tag-link' href='tags/attitude.html' rel='tag'>attitude</a> <a class='tag-link' href='tags/dance.html' rel='tag'>dance</a></p>

				<blockquote>
					<p>As a dancing partner Rose Tuttle was not a bargain. She was equipped for it physically and she had some idea of rhythm, that wasn&#8217;t it; it was her basic attitude. She danced cheerfully, and of course that was no good. You can&#8217;t dance cheerfully. Dancing is too important. It can be wild or solemn or gay or lewd or art for art&#8217;s sake, but it can&#8217;t be cheerful. </p>

				<h3>&ldquo;Making something with a great deal of care and love&rdquo;</h3>

				<p class="tags-align"><a class='tag-link' href='tags/love.html' rel='tag'>love</a></p>

				<blockquote>
					<p>One of the ways that I believe people express their appreciation to the rest of humanity is to make something wonderful and put it out there. </p>

<p>And you never meet the people. You never shake their hands. You never hear their story or tell yours. But somehow, in the act of making something with a great deal of care and love, something’s transmitted there. And it’s a way of expressing to the rest of our species our deep appreciation. So we need to be true to who we are and remember what’s really important to us. </p>

				<h3>&ldquo;The pulse of nature&rdquo;</h3>

				<p class="tags-align"><a class='tag-link' href='tags/sustainability.html' rel='tag'>sustainability</a></p>

				<blockquote>
					<p>I wanted to teach people to listen to the pulse of nature, to partake of the wholeness of life and not forget, under the pressure of their petty destinies, that we are not gods and have not created ourselves but are children of the earth, part of the cosmos. </p>

				<h3>&ldquo;Nature must govern technology&rdquo;</h3>

				<p class="tags-align"></p>

				<blockquote>
					<p>If we&#8217;re ever going to get the world back on a natural footing, back in tune with natural rhythyms, if we&#8217;re going to nurture the Earth and protect it and have fun with it and learn from it — which is what mothers do with their children — then we&#8217;ve got to put technology (an aggressive masculine system) in its proper place, which is that of a tool to be used sparingly, joyfully, gently and only in the fullest cooperation with nature. Nature must govern technology, not the other way around. </p>

				<h3>&ldquo;Skepticism and Openness&rdquo;</h3>

				<p class="tags-align"><a class='tag-link' href='tags/critical-thinking.html' rel='tag'>critical thinking</a></p>

				<blockquote>
					<p>It seems to me what is called for is an exquisite balance between two conflicting needs: the most skeptical scrutiny of all hypotheses that are served up to us and at the same time a great openness to new ideas. Obviously those two modes of thought are in some tension. But if you are able to exercise only one of these modes, whichever one it is, you’re in deep trouble. </p>

<p>Some ideas are better than others. The machinery for distinguishing them is an essential tool in dealing with the world and especially in dealing with the future. And it is precisely the mix of these two modes of thought that is central to the success of science. </p>

				<h3>&ldquo;All children of our Earth&rdquo;</h3>

				<p class="tags-align"><a class='tag-link' href='tags/connection.html' rel='tag'>connection</a></p>

				<blockquote>
					<p>We were flying over America, and suddenly I saw snow, the first snow we ever saw from orbit. I have never visited America, but I imagined that the arrival of autumn and winter is the same there as in other places, and the process of getting ready for them is the same. And then it struck me that we are all children of our Earth. </p>

				<h3>&ldquo;The Myth of Simple Truths&rdquo;</h3>

				<p class="tags-align"><a class='tag-link' href='tags/critical-thinking.html' rel='tag'>critical thinking</a></p>

				<blockquote>
					<p>It would be a wonderful world were the Simple Truth Thesis true. Our political task simply would be to empower those who know the simple truth, and rebuke the fools who do not. But the Simple Truth Thesis is not true. In fact, it&#8217;s a fairytale—soothing, but ultimately unfit for a serious mind. For any Big Question, there are several defensible positions; it is precisely this feature that makes them big. Of course, to say that a position is defensible is not to say that it&#8217;s true. To oppose the Simple Truth Thesis is not to embrace relativism (which is itself a version of the Simple Truth view), nor is it to give up on the idea that there is truth; it is rather to give up on the view that the truth is always simple. </p>

				<h3>&ldquo;Unlike cynicism, hopefulness is hard-earned&rdquo;</h3>

				<p class="tags-align"><a class='tag-link' href='tags/faith.html' rel='tag'>faith</a> <a class='tag-link' href='tags/hope.html' rel='tag'>hope</a></p>

				<blockquote>
					<p>Unlike cynicism, hopefulness is hard-earned, makes demands upon us, and can often feel like the most indefensible and lonely place on Earth. Hopefulness is not a neutral position either. It is adversarial. It is the warrior emotion that can lay waste to cynicism. Each redemptive or loving act, as small as you like, Valerio, such as reading to your little boy, or showing him a thing you love, or singing him a song, or putting on his shoes, keeps the devil down in the hole. It says the world and its inhabitants have value and are worth defending. It says the world is worth believing in. In time, we come to find that it is so. </p>

				<h3>&ldquo;How to Grow Old&rdquo;</h3>

				<p class="tags-align"><a class='tag-link' href='tags/aging.html' rel='tag'>aging</a></p>

				<blockquote>
					<p>Make your interests gradually wider and more impersonal, until bit by bit the walls of the ego recede, and your life becomes increasingly merged in the universal life. An individual human existence should be like a river — small at first, narrowly contained within its banks, and rushing passionately past rocks and over waterfalls. Gradually the river grows wider, the banks recede, the waters flow more quietly, and in the end, without any visible break, they become merged in the sea, and painlessly lose their individual being. </p>

				<h3>&ldquo;The language of religion and poetry&rdquo;</h3>

				<p class="tags-align"><a class='tag-link' href='tags/art.html' rel='tag'>art</a> <a class='tag-link' href='tags/religion.html' rel='tag'>religion</a></p>

				<blockquote>
					<p>We ought to remember that religion uses language in quite a different way from science. The language of religion is more closely related to the language of poetry than to the language of science. True, we are inclined to think that science deals with information about objective facts, and poetry with subjective feelings. Hence we conclude that if religion does indeed deal with objective truths, it ought to adopt the same criteria of truth as science. But I myself find the division of the world into an objective and a subjective side much too arbitrary. The fact that religions through the ages have spoken in images, parables, and paradoxes means simply that there are no other ways of grasping the reality to which they refer. But that does not mean that it is not a genuine reality. And splitting this reality into an objective and a subjective side won’t get us very far. </p>

				<h3>&ldquo;The freedom to enact other forms of social existence&rdquo;</h3>

				<p class="tags-align"><a class='tag-link' href='tags/society.html' rel='tag'>society</a></p>

				<blockquote>
					<p>If something did go terribly wrong in human history &#8211; and given the current state of the world, it&#8217;s hard to deny something did &#8211; then perhaps it began to go wrong precisely when people started losing that freedom to imagine and enact other forms of social existence, to such a degree that some now feel this particular type of freedom hardly even existed, or was barely exercised, for the greater part of human history. </p>

				<h3>&ldquo;Three basic forms of social liberty&rdquo;</h3>

				<p class="tags-align"><a class='tag-link' href='tags/autonomy.html' rel='tag'>autonomy</a></p>

				<blockquote>
					<p>But for us, the key point to remember is that we are not talking here about &#8216;freedom&#8217; as an abstract ideal or formal principle (as in &#8216;Liberty, Equality and Fraternity!&#8217;). Over the course of these pages we have instead talked about basic forms of social liberty which one might actually put into practice: (1) the freedom to move away or relocate from one&#8217;s surroundings; (2) the freedom to ignore or disobey commands issued by others; and (3) the freedom to shape entirely new social realities, or shift back and forth between different ones. </p>

At the back of our brains… [there is] a forgotten blaze or burst of astonishment at our own existence. The object of the artistic and spiritual life [is] to dig for this submerged sunrise of wonder; so that a man sitting in a chair might suddenly understand that he [is] actually alive, and be happy. </p>
