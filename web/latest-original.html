				<h3><a class="implicit" href="writings/remembering-hank.html">Remembering Hank</a></h3>
				
				<p>I still remember the first time we laid eyes on Hank. It was a sunny day in May, and we met him and his current owner in a park somewhere nearby, on neutral territory. And then, when we saw Hank, I quickly realized the gravity of the decision we were about to make. Because Hank was tail-waggingly perfect. So there was no question of passing on him, and holding out for a <em>better</em> dog. Because I couldn’t imagine what a better dog would look like. </p>

				<h3><a class="implicit" href="writings/it-takes-all-kinds.html">It Takes All Kinds</a></h3>
				
				<p>Seems a pity that this timeworn expression is not heard much anymore: &#8220;It takes all kinds.&#8221; Could express appreciation or grudging tolerance. Either seems vastly preferable to most of what we hear today about others who are different from us. </p>

				<h3><a class="implicit" href="writings/thoughts-on-ai-apple-and-otherwise.html">Thoughts on AI: Apple and Otherwise</a></h3>
				
				<p>There’s been a lot of discussion lately about AI, and Apple’s AI problems in particular, and I have some potentially useful, and perhaps even original, thoughts on these subjects. Amidst all the fascination about the amazing things that AI can do, I think many of us tend to lose sight of some of the <em>essential characteristics</em> of this relatively new technology. </p>

				<h3><a class="implicit" href="writings/more-markdown-and-html-please.html">More Markdown and HTML, Please</a></h3>
				
				<p>Markdown is admittedly not for everyone, and not equally useful in all contexts, but its usage continues to grow, and arguably has more headroom for further growth. </p>

				<h3><a class="implicit" href="writings/my-rides-here.html">My Ride&apos;s Here</a></h3>
				
				<p>This is a great song written and recorded by Warren Zevon, and co-written by Paul Muldoon. It appeared on Zevon&#8217;s 2002 album of the same name. The song explores varying attitudes towards death, and towards the prospect of dying. Zevon himself died in 2003, at the age of only 56. </p>

				<h3><a class="implicit" href="writings/how-the-dems-lost-it.html">How the Dems Lost It</a></h3>
				
				<p>Everyone else already seems to have taken a crack at explaining how the Democrats lost so thoroughly in our last national elections — and what they need to contemplate by way of course correction — so I guess it must be my turn to weigh in. </p>
