<p>These are my latest original writings, with the most recent ones at the top.  </p>

<h3><a href="writings/ring-them-bells.html">Ring Them Bells</a></h3>

<p>This is a gem of a Dylan song: not a big, gaudy rock, but a modest yet finely wrought masterpiece.  I find Dylan&#8217;s original version to be a bit slow and somnolent, but the song comes alive for me when I hear Sarah Jarosz sing it. </p>

<h3><a href="writings/five-takeaways-from-the-first-2024-presidential-debate.html">Five Takeaways from the First 2024 Presidential Debate</a></h3>

<p>Everyone’s got their opinions about the debate last night, so I suppose I may as well share mine. </p>

<h3><a href="writings/some-hard-truths-about-human-population-growth.html">Some Hard Truths About Human Population Growth</a></h3>

<p>From one billion to eight billion in two hundred years. Is it really sustainable for our planet to try to support so many people? </p>

<h3><a href="writings/reflections-on-the-christian-message.html">Reflections on the Christian Message</a></h3>

<p>As I’ve confessed on previous occasions, I don’t really think of myself as a Christian, although I was raised by at least one parent who was a reliable Methodist for most of her life. But I’ve been reflecting on the Christian message recently, and since Christmas is approaching, I suppose there’s no better time of year for this sort of contemplation. When I think of the overarching message of Christ, three central concepts stand out for me. </p>

<h3><a href="writings/the-rotary-four-way-test.html">The Rotary Four-Way Test</a></h3>

<p>This is a nonpartisan and nonsectarian ethical test that individuals can apply to their personal and professional relationships. The original author was Herbert J. Taylor. It was adopted by the Rotary organization in the 1940's. </p>

<h3><a href="writings/social-support-survey.html">Social Support Survey</a></h3>

<p>This is a simple survey that anyone can use to self-assess the degree of social support they are feeling in their lives. I picked this up from David R. Samson&#8217;s book <em>Our Tribal Future</em>, but he says that he adapted it from other sources. </p>

<h3><a href="writings/pancho-and-lefty.html">Pancho and Lefty</a></h3>

<p>I&#8217;ve already written about &#8220;Long Black Veil,&#8221; which was one one of my father&#8217;s favorite songs. So I&#8217;m probably overdue to write about &#8220;Pancho and Lefty,&#8221; which was one of my father-in-law&#8217;s favorites &#8211; and one of mine as well. A bit like &#8220;Hallelujah,&#8221; by Leonard Cohen, this song seems to have had an interesting life of its own. </p>
