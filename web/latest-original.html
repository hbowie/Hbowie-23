				<h2>The Latest Words by H. Bowie</h2>

				<p>These are my latest original writings, with the most recent ones at the top.  </p>

				<h3><a class="implicit" href="writings/my-education-in-racial-superiority.html">My Education in Racial Superiority</a></h3>
				
				<p>For what it&#8217;s worth, a personal story about my education on the subject of racial superiority. &#8220;I am, to all appearances, white, and my ancestry, as far as it can be determined, is mostly European. But please don’t hold that against me.&#8221; </p>

				<h3><a class="implicit" href="writings/new-speedway-boogie.html">New Speedway Boogie</a></h3>
				
				<p>I’ve been thinking a lot lately about this Grateful Dead song, written by Robert Hunter and Jerry Garcia. The lyrics were famously penned by Hunter in the wake of the fateful Altamont Concert in 1969, but the words and music still carry meaning for us today. </p>

				<h3><a class="implicit" href="writings/the-problem-with-ai-art.html">The Problem with AI Art</a></h3>
				
				<p>Once we learn that a work has been generated by AI, this initial interest — this potential beginning of a human relationship with the work and its author — is suddenly replaced by a hideous void, as we realize we have been duped, have been presented with what purports to be a human communication but is now revealed as having come from a source that is profoundly inhuman and, perhaps, even anti-human. </p>

				<h3><a class="implicit" href="writings/pay-it-no-mind.html">Pay It No Mind</a></h3>
				
				<p>An appreciation for this lovely little song by Sarah Jarosz, offering us some hope and inspiration for trying times. </p>

				<h3><a class="implicit" href="writings/trump-2.0-some-insights-and-observations.html">Trump 2.0: Some Insights and Observations</a></h3>
				
				<p>A lot is being said about Trump 2.0 on an hourly basis, but most of the viewpoints expressed seem to be the same ones over and over. But I think there are some interesting (and perhaps useful) patterns that are not being talked about much. And so I talk about them. Right here. </p>

				<h3><a class="implicit" href="writings/please-can-we-just-have-fewer-children.html">Please, Can We Just Have Fewer Children?</a></h3>
				
				<p>I often feel like I’m living some weird Sci-Fi reality in which part of our social consciousness is completely severed from another. In one half of our brains, we read articles complaining that the end of civilization is nigh because people in many countries (including mine, the US) are having too few children. “Why aren’t people having more babies?”, these articles ask. “What is wrong with them? What is going on?” But then, seemingly in another entirely separate part of our consciousness, we see articles talking about looming environmental catastrophe and the ever-increasing costs of simply living, let alone bearing and raising children. </p>

				<h3><a class="implicit" href="writings/the-era-of-destructive-tech-is-upon-us.html">The Era of Destructive Tech is Upon Us</a></h3>
				
				<p>I wrote an essay a few years ago that asked the question: <em>Have We Passed The Point of Maximum Useful Tech?</em> In it I defined a series of distinct models of computer usage that have emerged over the last several decades. We’ve reached the point, though, at which I need to amend it by adding a new model that is becoming more prevalent. I am forced to call it “The Destructive Model.” It is characterized by ever-higher demands for processing power without producing any significant benefits for humanity. This sort of destructive tech consists primarily of new forms of so-called “artificial intelligence,” along with cryptocurrency. </p>
