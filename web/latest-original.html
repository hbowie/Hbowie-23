<h3><a href="writings/reflections-on-the-christian-message.html">Reflections on the Christian Message</a></h3>

<p>As I’ve confessed on previous occasions, I don’t really think of myself as a Christian, although I was raised by at least one parent who was a reliable Methodist for most of her life. But I’ve been reflecting on the Christian message recently, and since Christmas is approaching, I suppose there’s no better time of year for this sort of contemplation. When I think of the overarching message of Christ, three central concepts stand out for me. </p>

<h3><a href="writings/the-rotary-four-way-test.html">The Rotary Four-Way Test</a></h3>

<p>This is a nonpartisan and nonsectarian ethical test that individuals can apply to their personal and professional relationships. The original author was Herbert J. Taylor. It was adopted by the Rotary organization in the 1940's. </p>

<h3><a href="writings/social-support-survey.html">Social Support Survey</a></h3>

<p>This is a simple survey that anyone can use to self-assess the degree of social support they are feeling in their lives. I picked this up from David R. Samson&#8217;s book <em>Our Tribal Future</em>, but he says that he adapted it from other sources. </p>

<h3><a href="writings/pancho-and-lefty.html">Pancho and Lefty</a></h3>

<p>I&#8217;ve already written about &#8220;Long Black Veil,&#8221; which was one one of my father&#8217;s favorite songs. So I&#8217;m probably overdue to write about &#8220;Pancho and Lefty,&#8221; which was one of my father-in-law&#8217;s favorites &#8211; and one of mine as well. A bit like &#8220;Hallelujah,&#8221; by Leonard Cohen, this song seems to have had an interesting life of its own. </p>

<h3><a href="writings/they-all-laughed.html">They All Laughed</a></h3>

<p>I first heard this song as part of the soundtrack to a movie with the same name, made by Peter Bogdanovich in 1981. The movie is worth watching, if you like quirky (as I generally do), but it was the song that stuck with me. This was really my introduction to the songs of George and Ira Gershwin, with George supplying the music, and brother Ira providing the lyrics. </p>

<h3><a href="writings/managing-our-identity-stacks.html">Managing Our Identity Stacks</a></h3>

<p>While reading David R. Samson&#8217;s book <em>Our Tribal Drive</em> I came across a new concept, called an identity stack. This seems to be a really useful way to think about our identities, and how they are constructed. </p>

<h3><a href="writings/a-universal-improvement-process.html">A Universal Improvement Process</a></h3>

<p>These are the elements of a generalized improvement process, integrating components of natural selection, the scientific method and various disciplines for product and process improvement. </p>
