				<h2>The Latest Words by H. Bowie</h2>

				<p>These are my latest original writings, with the most recent ones at the top.  </p>

				<h3><a class="implicit" href="writings/tribal-instincts.html">Tribal Instincts</a></h3>
				
				<p>Michael Morris offers us three basic tribal instincts: to honor our ancestors through continuation of tradition, to mesh with our peers, and to pursue heroic contributions. </p>

				<h3><a class="implicit" href="writings/developmental-levels-as-complementary-modes-of-behavior.html">Developmental Levels as Complementary Modes of Behavior</a></h3>
				
				<p>I’ve been fascinated by the concept of developmental levels ever since coming across the model in an early book by Ken Wilber, but lately I’ve come to believe that these so-called <em>levels</em> are better thought of as differing, but complementary, modes of human behavior.  <br />

				<h3><a class="implicit" href="writings/desperados-under-the-eaves.html">Desperados Under the Eaves</a></h3>
				
				<p>I’ve been wondering lately why I’ve never written an appreciation for any of Warren Zevon’s songs. It’s certainly not that he didn’t give us many great tracks to choose from. Upon reflection, perhaps it’s because he wrote so many compact little gems that it’s hard to pick just one. Whatever the reason, this song of his has been haunting me lately, so it’s time to correct the omission. </p>

				<p>Here’s a quick list of thoughts and feelings coming to me one day after we’ve learned the results of the 2024 presidential election. </p>

				<h3><a class="implicit" href="writings/a-note-for-posterity.html">A Note For Posterity</a></h3>
				
				<p>As one gets on in years, their thoughts turn somewhat naturally to whatever bits of wisdom they might want to document and leave behind for the edification of future generations: you know, so that all these years of living and reading and pondering might not have been in vain. </p>

				<h3><a class="implicit" href="writings/the-social-suite.html">The Social Suite</a></h3>
				
				<p>Nicholas A. Christakis, in his book <em>Blueprint</em>, defines eight human features that form the core of all societies. As he says, these features arise from within individuals but they characterize groups, and so they form a relatively small set of universal features that supports the self-assembly of humans into societies. </p>

				<h3><a class="implicit" href="writings/step-by-step.html">Step by Step</a></h3>
				
				<p>I&#8217;ve been a fan of Jesse Winchester&#8217;s for a long time, but hadn&#8217;t really paid much attention to this gem until I stumbled across it a few days ago. It&#8217;s a fine addition to Winchester&#8217;s small but accomplished set of songs about god and religion. </p>
