<p>These are my latest original writings, with the most recent ones at the top.  </p>

<h3><a href="writings/they-all-laughed.html">They All Laughed</a></h3>

<p>I first heard this song as part of the soundtrack to a movie with the same name, made by Peter Bogdanovich in 1981. The movie is worth watching, if you like quirky (as I generally do), but it was the song that stuck with me. This was really my introduction to the songs of George and Ira Gershwin, with George supplying the music, and brother Ira providing the lyrics. </p>

<h3><a href="writings/managing-our-identity-stacks.html">Managing Our Identity Stacks</a></h3>

<p>While reading David R. Samson&#8217;s book <em>Our Tribal Drive</em> I came across a new concept, called an identity stack. This seems to be a really useful way to think about our identities, and how they are constructed. </p>

<h3><a href="writings/when-i-paint-my-masterpiece.html">When I Paint My Masterpiece</a></h3>

<p>I&#8217;ve been reading Rick Rubin&#8217;s book <em>The Creative Act: A Way of Being</em> lately &#8211; not all at once, mind you, but sipping it slowly, like a rare old whiskey &#8211; and it&#8217;s put me in mind of this song by Bob Dylan, from 1971. This composition has been performed and recorded by Dylan himself on multiple occasions, but the first released recording was by The Band, and their original studio recording is still the version I&#8217;m partial to. </p>
