	  	<p>I&apos;ve done a major redesign of my personal site at HBowie.net. This has now become an ongoing central repository for my digital commonplace book and for all of my shorter pieces that I think are still worth reading. Feel free to look around. </p>

	  	<p>Notenik 12.7.0 is out. The biggest change is the sorting out of various controls for navigating through a Collection. There are three different paths a user can traverse, going both backwards and forwards. The first path just travels sequentially through the list, using the currently selected sort sequence. The second path goes back and forth through navigation history within the app. The third path goes forwards and back through search results. These three are all now enabled in both directions, with separate controls for each, and with sensible keyboard shortcuts for all options. Thanks to valuable user input on the Notenik Discourse forum for these suggestions! </p>

	  	<p>This song by Bob Dylan, first recorded by The Band, had been haunting me lately, so I decided to write a little something about it. </p>

	  	<p>Notenik 10 received a nice review in the January issues of both MacLife and MacFormat, and was awared four out of five stars! </p>

<p>Notenik 11.7.0 was released on March 27th. </p>

<p>I keep adding new features to the app, either because I want/need them, or because another current or prospective user has requested them. </p>

	  	<p>This is my newest site, and a spot where I can bring together all of the writings about songs I&apos;ve done over the years. There&apos;s some content from <em>Reason to Rock</em> here, as well as some stuff from <em>The Practical Utopian</em>, plus newer stuff. But since these are the most popular pieces I&apos;ve written over the years (according to Google), I thought it was high time to have a single site dedicated to this material. The title of the site comes from a Bob Dylan quotation (see the &quot;About&quot; page for details). </p>

	  	<p>If execs cannot mandate the same corporate attire for everyone, what makes them think that mandating a certain number of days per week in the office is a good thing? The same flaw lurks in both approaches: every employee is not the same. Every situation is not the same. Every team is not the same. </p>
