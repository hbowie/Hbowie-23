				<p>In 1800, the total human population on our planet was only 1 billion people. It took 127 years for that number to double to 2 billion. But then it took only 33 years to add the next billion. Since then, we’ve been adding another billion every 11 - 14 years, and doubling our population about every fifty years. At this point, in 2024, we now have in excess of 8 billion people on our planet – and we’re adding another quarter million every day. </p>

				<p>Version 14.0.0 of my Mac app Notenik is out today, and available from the Mac App Store. A Notenik user recently posted a really good description of how Notenik differs from other (generally better-known) tools, and I suggest you <a href="https://discourse.notenik.app/t/why-notenik-vs-logseq-obsidian-or-devonthink/405/3?u=hbowie" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">read that</a> if you&#8217;re wondering what it is that makes Notenik special. </p>

				<p>Notenik 12.7.0 is out. The biggest change is the sorting out of various controls for navigating through a Collection. There are three different paths a user can traverse, going both backwards and forwards. The first path just travels sequentially through the list, using the currently selected sort sequence. The second path goes back and forth through navigation history within the app. The third path goes forwards and back through search results. These three are all now enabled in both directions, with separate controls for each, and with sensible keyboard shortcuts for all options. Thanks to valuable user input on the Notenik Discourse forum for these suggestions! </p>

					</a>
				<p>This is my newest site, and a spot where I can bring together all of the writings about songs I&#8217;ve done over the years. There&#8217;s some content from <em>Reason to Rock</em> here, as well as some stuff from <em>The Practical Utopian</em>, plus newer stuff. But since these are the most popular pieces I&#8217;ve written over the years (according to Google), I thought it was high time to have a single site dedicated to this material. The title of the site comes from a Bob Dylan quotation (see the &#8220;About&#8221; page for details). </p>

					</a>
				<p>If execs cannot mandate the same corporate attire for everyone, what makes them think that mandating a certain number of days per week in the office is a good thing? The same flaw lurks in both approaches: every employee is not the same. Every situation is not the same. Every team is not the same. </p>
