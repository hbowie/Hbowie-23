<p>I was one of the 15,000 people who gathered under the Space Needle yesterday to hear Warren speak. There were several things about her that impressed me. </p>
<ul>
<li><p>She emphasized the need for structural change, starting with getting big money out of politics. This just makes so much sense because, without it, we&#8217;ll soon be right back where we are now. </p></li>
<li><p>She talked about the need for a wealth tax. This really clicked for me yesterday for the first time. I got it. People don&#8217;t like income tax, because everyone has income, and no one wants to lose any of it to taxation. On the other hand, not everyone has wealth â€” especially as Warren defines it, above $50 million. So it will be easier to get voters to accept a new wealth tax than increases in income tax. </p></li>
<li><p>As part of her opening origin story, she talked a lot about her &#8220;much older&#8221; brothers. It wasn&#8217;t until I was riding home on the bus afterwards that I realized how smart this was, because it makes her sound much younger than her 70 years. </p></li>
</ul>

<p>All in all, she seems like a smart policy person who genuinely has our country&#8217;s best interests at heart. but also a smart campaigner. </p>
