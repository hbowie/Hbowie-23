		<blockquote>
			<p>Education demands a certain daring, a certain independence of mind. We have to teach young people to think. And to teach young people, in order to teach young people to think, you have to teach them to think about everything. There mustn&#8217;t be something they cannot think about. If there&#8217;s something, if there&#8217;s one thing they can&#8217;t think about, then very shortly they can&#8217;t think about anything, you know. Now, there&#8217;s always something in this country, of course, one cannot think about. </p>

			<p>If the concept of God has any validity or any use, it can only be to make us larger, freer, and more loving. If God cannot do this, then it is time we got rid of Him. </p>

		<blockquote>
			<p>I do not know many Negroes who are eager to be &#8216;accepted&#8217; by white people, still less to be loved by them; they, the blacks, simply don&#8217;t wish to be beaten over the head by the whites every instant of our brief passage on this planet. White people will have quite enough to do in learning how to accept and love themselves and each other, and when they have achieved this &#8211; which will not be tomorrow and may very well be never &#8211; the Negro problem will no longer exist, for it will no longer be needed. </p>

		<h4>&ldquo;The moment we cease to hold each other&rdquo;</h4>
		
		<p class="tags-align">tags: <a class='tag-link' href='topics/love.html' rel='tag'>love</a></p>

		<blockquote>
			<p>For nothing is fixed, forever and forever, it is not fixed; the earth is always shifting, the light is always changing, the sea does not cease to grind down rock. Generations do not cease to be born, and we are responsible to them because we are the only witnesses they have. The sea rises, the light fails, lovers cling to each other and children cling to us. The moment we cease to hold each other, the moment we break faith with one another, the sea engulfs us and the light goes out. </p>

		<h4>&ldquo;Any Love for Justice&rdquo;</h4>
		
		<p class="tags-align">tags: <a class='tag-link' href='topics/equality.html' rel='tag'>equality</a>, <a class='tag-link' href='topics/rule-of-law.html' rel='tag'>rule of law</a></p>

		<blockquote>
			<p>Well, if one really wishes to know how justice is administered in a country, one does not question the policemen, the lawyers, the judges, or the protected members of the middle class. One goes to the unprotected &#8211; those, precisely, who need the law&#8217;s protection most! &#8211; and listens to their testimony. Ask any Mexican, any Puerto Rican, any black man, any poor person &#8211; ask the wretched how they fare in the halls of justice, and then you will know, not whether or not the country is just, but whether or not it has any love for justice, or any concept of it. It is certain, in any case, that ignorance, allied with power, is the most ferocious enemy justice can have. </p>

		<h4>&ldquo;An emotional poverty so bottomless&rdquo;</h4>
		
		<p class="tags-align">tags: <a class='tag-link' href='topics/connection.html' rel='tag'>connection</a></p>

		<blockquote>
			<p>I have always been struck, in America, by an emotional poverty so bottomless, and a terror of human life, of human touch, so deep that virtually no American appears able to achieve any viable, organic connection between his public stance and his private life. </p>
