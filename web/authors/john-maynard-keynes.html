		<h4>&ldquo;Technological Unemployment&rdquo;</h4>
		
		<p class="tags-align"><a class='tag-link' href='../tags/value-creation.html' rel='tag'>value creation</a></p>

		<blockquote>
			<p>We are being afflicted with a new disease of which some readers may not yet have heard the name, but of which they will hear a great deal in the years to come &#8211; namely, technological unemployment. This means unemployment due to our discovery of means of economising the use of labour outrunning the pace at which we can find new uses for labour. </p>
		</blockquote>

		<p>From  the essay
			&ldquo;Economic Possibilities for our Grandchildren&rdquo;
		</p>
		<p>&mdash; 1930</p>
