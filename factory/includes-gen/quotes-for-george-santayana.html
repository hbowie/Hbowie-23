		<h4>&ldquo;Progress Depends on Retentiveness&rdquo;</h4>
		
		<p class="tags-align"><a class='tag-link' href='../tags/progress.html' rel='tag'>progress</a> <a class='tag-link' href='../tags/retention.html' rel='tag'>retention</a></p>

		<blockquote>
			<p>Progress, far from consisting in change, depends on retentiveness. When change is absolute there remains no being to improve and no direction is set for possible improvement: and when experience is not retained, as among savages, infancy is perpetual. Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it. </p>
