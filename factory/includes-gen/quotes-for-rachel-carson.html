		<h4>&ldquo;The conquest of nature&rdquo;</h4>
		
		<p class="tags-align"></p>

		<blockquote>
			<p>Man has long talked somewhat arrogantly about the conquest of nature; now he has the power to achieve his boast. It is our misfortune &#8211; it may well be our final tragedy &#8211; that this power has not been tempered with wisdom, but has been marked by irresponsibility; that there is all too little awareness that man is part of nature, and that the price of conquest may well be the destruction of man himself. </p>
		</blockquote>

		<p>From
