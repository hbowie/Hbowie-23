		<blockquote>
			<p>There are two novels that can change a bookish fourteen-year old&#8217;s life: The <cite>Lord of the Rings</cite> and <cite>Atlas Shrugged</cite>. One is a childish fantasy that often engenders a lifelong obsession with its unbelievable heroes, leading to an emotionally stunted, socially crippled adulthood, unable to deal with the real world. The other, of course, involves orcs. </p>
