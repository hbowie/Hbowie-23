		<blockquote>
			<p>On the face of it, shareholder value is the dumbest idea in the world. Shareholder value is a result, not a strategy&#8230; your main constituencies are your employees, your customers and your products. Managers and investors should not set share price increases as their overarching goal. &#8230; Short-term profits should be allied with an increase in the long-term value of a company. </p>
