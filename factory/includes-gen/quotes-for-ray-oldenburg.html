		<blockquote>
			<p>Most needed are those &#8216;third places&#8217; which lend a public balance to the increased privatization of home life. Third places are nothing more than informal public gathering places. The phrase &#8216;third places&#8217; derives from considering our homes to be the &#8216;first&#8217; places in our lives, and our work places the &#8216;second.&#8217; </p>
