		<blockquote>
			<p>As we explore the natural history of tribalism, we will see that some three hundred thousand years ago humans chanced upon a revolutionary adaptation that led to the encoding of the Tribe Drive in our DNA. This was the evolution of nested groups, each with their own particular symbols &#8211; and enshrined shared myths and values &#8211; that bound participants together in trusting relationships. </p>

		<h4>&ldquo;Paradoxes rationally serve as tribal loyalty tests&rdquo;</h4>

		<blockquote>
			<p>Anthropologist Claude Levi-Strauss made the argument that the purpose of mythology is to create paradoxes (for example, the Holy Ghost is a paradoxical trinity where God the father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit are one and the same). It is a mystery that must be believed nevertheless. Paradoxes rationally serve as tribal loyalty tests because the more logic-defying the premise, the stronger the tribal signal. </p>

		<blockquote>
			<p>There is growing evidence that tribalism is the systematic weaponization of the human Tribe Drive and will be one of the twenty-first century&#8217;s greatest military tools in global competition. It may be the greatest threat humanity faces. </p>
