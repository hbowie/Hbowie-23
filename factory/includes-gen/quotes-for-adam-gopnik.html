		<h4>&ldquo;Human psychology will never be fully explained&rdquo;</h4>
		
		<p class="tags-align"><a class='tag-link' href='../tags/art.html' rel='tag'>art</a> <a class='tag-link' href='../tags/science.html' rel='tag'>science</a></p>

		<blockquote>
			<p>It&#8217;s all the reasons why human psychology will never be fully explained or pictured by scientific investigation — there are just too many variables, too many vectors pressing in on every incident. It&#8217;s the reason why storytelling and songwriting and poetry-making will always be so much more effective organizers and vehicles of our experience than studies in social science. </p>
