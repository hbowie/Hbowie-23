		<h4>&ldquo;Play is a thing on its own&rdquo;</h4>
		
		<p class="tags-align"><a class='tag-link' href='../tags/play.html' rel='tag'>play</a></p>

		<blockquote>
			<p>The incidence of play is not associated with any particular stage of civilization or view of the universe. Any thinking person can see at a glance that play is a thing on its own, even if his language possesses no general concept to express it. Play cannot be denied. You can deny, if you like, nearly all abstractions: justice, beauty, truth, goodness, mind, God. You can deny seriousness, but not play. </p>
