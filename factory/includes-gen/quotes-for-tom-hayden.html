		<h4>&ldquo;American decline&rdquo;</h4>
		
		<p class="tags-align"><a class='tag-link' href='../tags/usa.html' rel='tag'>USA</a></p>

		<blockquote>
			<p>Not only did tarnish appear on our image of American virtue, not only did disillusion occur when the hypocrisy of American ideals was discovered, but we began to sense that what we had originally seen as the American Golden Age was actually the decline of an era. The worldwide outbreak of revolution against colonialism and imperialism, the entrenchment of totalitarian states, the menace of war, overpopulation, international disorder, supertechnology &#8211; these trends were testing the tenacity of our own commitment to democracy and freedom and our abilities to visualize their application to a world in upheaval. </p>

		<h4>&ldquo;Mankind desperately needs revolutionary leadership&rdquo;</h4>
		
		<p class="tags-align"><a class='tag-link' href='../tags/governance.html' rel='tag'>governance</a></p>

		<blockquote>
			<p>Although our own technology is destroying old and creating new forms of social organization, men still tolerate meaningless work and idleness. While two-thirds of mankind suffers under nourishment, our own upper classes revel amidst superfluous abundance. Although world population is expected to double in forty years, the nations still tolerate anarchy as a major principle of international conduct and uncontrolled exploitation governs the sapping of the earth&#8217;s physical resources. Although mankind desperately needs revolutionary leadership, America rests in national stalemate, its goals ambiguous and tradition-bound instead of informed and clear, its democratic system apathetic and manipulated rather than &#8220;of, by, and for the people.&#8221; </p>

		<h4>&ldquo;We may be the last generation in the experiment with living&rdquo;</h4>
		
		<p class="tags-align"><a class='tag-link' href='../tags/governance.html' rel='tag'>governance</a> <a class='tag-link' href='../tags/sustainability.html' rel='tag'>sustainability</a></p>

		<blockquote>
			<p>Our work is guided by the sense that we may be the last generation in the experiment with living. But we are a minority &#8211; the vast majority of our people regard the temporary equilibriums of our society and world as eternally functional parts. In this is perhaps the outstanding paradox; we ourselves are imbued with urgency, yet the message of our society is that there is no viable alternative to the present. Beneath the reassuring tones of the politicians, beneath the common opinion that America will &#8220;muddle through,&#8221; beneath the stagnation of those who have closed their minds to the future, is the pervading feeling that there simply are no alternatives, that our times have witnessed the exhaustion not only of Utopias, but of any new departures as well. Feeling the press of complexity upon the emptiness of life, people are fearful of the thought that at any moment things might be thrust out of control. They fear change itself, since change might smash whatever invisible framework seems to hold back chaos for them now. For most Americans, all crusades are suspect, threatening. The fact that each individual sees apathy in his fellows perpetuates the common reluctance to organize for change. The dominant institutions are complex enough to blunt the minds of their potential critics, and entrenched enough to swiftly dissipate or entirely repel the energies of protest and reform, thus limiting human expectancies. Then, too, we are a materially improved society, and by our own improvements we seem to have weakened the case for further change. </p>
