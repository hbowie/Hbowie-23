		The Rotary Four-Way Test
	</a>
</h3>

<p>This is a nonpartisan and nonsectarian ethical test that individuals can apply to their personal and professional relationships. </p>

<p>The original author was Herbert J. Taylor. </p>

<p>It was adopted by the Rotary organization in the 1940's. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>Of the things we think, say or do: </p>
<ol>
<li>Is it the truth? </li>
<li>Is it fair to all concerned? </li>
<li>Will it build goodwill and better friendships? </li>
<li>Will it be beneficial to all concerned? </li>
</ol>
</blockquote>

<p>Application of this test can be used to increase prosocial behavior, especially in a business environment. </p>
