<p>I&#8217;ve been a <a href="https://www.allmusic.com/artist/jesse-winchester-mn0000339905" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jesse Winchester</a> fan ever since I slipped his first album onto my turntable in my dorm room back in Ann Arbor, but somehow I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;d paid much attention to this gem until I stumbled across it yesterday. </p>

<p>This fits neatly into Winchester&#8217;s small but accomplished set of songs about god and religion â€” songs like &#8220;<a href="quiet-about-it.html" class="wiki-link">Quiet About It</a>&#8221; and &#8220;Isn&#8217;t That So?&#8221;. </p>

<p>One of the things I love about this group of Winchester songs is that he displays obvious familiarity with, and even sympathy for, the Christian tradition, but manages to bring an entirely fresh approach to his questioning of these sacred topics. </p>

<p>This song seems to start with the picture painted by the spiritual &#8220;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/When_the_Saints_Go_Marching_In" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">When The Saints Go Marching In</a>,&#8221; and then picks up from there. </p>

<p>Give a listen to the Winchester recording, then stroll with me through the lyrics. </p>
