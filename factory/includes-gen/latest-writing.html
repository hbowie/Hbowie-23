<p>I still remember the first time we laid eyes on Hank. </p>

<p>Pauline and I had lost our last Golden Retriever a year earlier, and I still wasn’t sure I was ready for another. But Pauline had enrolled with a local Golden rescue organization, and they had pretty quickly called and asked if we were interested in meeting a potential adoptee, a male that was only six months old. </p>

<p>It was a sunny day in May, and we met Hank and his current owner in a park somewhere, on neutral territory. </p>

<p>And then, when we saw Hank, I quickly realized the gravity of the decision we were about to make. </p>

<p>Because Hank was tail-waggingly perfect. </p>

<p>So there was no question of passing on him, and holding out for a <em>better</em> dog. </p>

<p>Because I couldn’t imagine what a better dog would look like. </p>

<p>And so began life with Hank. </p>

<p>Hank was a big, long, athletic dog. </p>
