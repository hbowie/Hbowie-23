		The Problem with AI Art
	</a>
</h3>

<p>I’ve seen the topic of AI art discussed a bit online recently. </p>

<p>There’s this graphic piece, “<a href="https://theoatmeal.com/comics/ai_art" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A Cartoonist’s Review of AI Art</a>,” from The Oatmeal, in which Matthew Inman writes: </p>

<blockquote>

<p>When I consume AI art, it also evokes a feeling. Good, bad, neutral — whatever. </p>

<p>Until I find out that it’s AI art. </p>

<p>Then I feel deflated, grossed out, and maybe a little bit bored. This feeling isn’t a choice. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>And then there’s <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/10/16/oatmeal-ai-art" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this response</a> from John Gruber, a blogger with whom I often find myself in ready agreement: </p>

<blockquote>

<p>I fundamentally disagree with the premise. I think it very much is a choice. If your opinion about a work of art changes after you find out which tools were used to make it, or who the artist is or what they’ve done, you’re no longer judging the art. You’re making a choice not to form your opinion based on the work itself, but rather on something else. </p>
