		Developmental Levels as Complementary Modes of Behavior
	</a>
</h3>

<p>I’ve been fascinated by the concept of <a href="https://practopian.org/blog/hbowie/developmental-levels.html" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">developmental levels</a> ever since coming across the model in an early book by <a href="https://kenwilber.com/" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ken Wilber</a>, but lately I’ve come to believe that these so-called <em>levels</em> are more usefully thought of as differing, but complementary, modes of human behavior.  </p>

A. Introduction</summary>

<p>Wilber’s work was based to a great degree on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiral_Dynamics" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Spiral Dynamics</a> theory, as originated by Clare Graves, and as described by Don Beck and Christopher Cowan in their book of the same name. </p>

<p>These “value memes,” as they are called in Spiral Dynamics circles, are often described as emergent levels of cultural evolution, or as levels of individual consciousness. And to some degree I think these descriptions are accurate. </p></details>
