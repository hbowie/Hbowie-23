		An Appreciation for <cite>The Thin Man</cite>
	</a>
</h3>

<p><em>The Thin Man</em> is a film from 1934 based on the mystery novel of the same name by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dashiell_Hammett" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dashiell Hammett</a>. </p>

<p>In my judgment, this is one of those rare cases where the film is actually better than the book, without sacrificing much of value from the written text. </p>

<p>I’ve watched the film repeatedly over the years and my appreciation for it has only grown with each viewing. </p>

<p>Here’s why. </p>

<p><em>(Warning: some of my analysis may contain plot spoilers. If you’re concerned about such things, watch the film first before reading further).</em> </p>

<p>The timing of the film was propitious: the book and film came out just after the end of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prohibition_in_the_United_States" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Prohibition</a>, and the film was made and released quickly, just before the stricter enforcement of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hays_Code" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hays Code</a> began. </p>
