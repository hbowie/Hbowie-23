		How the Dems Lost It
	</a>
</h3>

<p>Everyone else already seems to have taken a crack at explaining how the Democrats lost so thoroughly in our last national elections — and what they need to contemplate by way of course correction — so I guess it must be my turn to weigh in. </p>

<p>I’m going to employ a couple of different <a href="https://hbowie.net/reference.html" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reference models</a> as frameworks for my analysis and commentary. You may not be familiar with them, but I’ll provide some small summaries as we go, as well as links for further details. </p>

<p>I’ll be focusing mostly on <em>image</em> and <em>messaging</em> — although of course actions influence perceptions. </p>

<p>And my commentary will be focused on the progressive wing of the Democratic party, since this is the group that has most forcefully been shaping perceptions of late. </p>
