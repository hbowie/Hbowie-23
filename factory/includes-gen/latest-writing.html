		Thoughts on AI: Apple and Otherwise

<p>There’s been a lot of discussion lately about AI, and Apple’s AI problems in particular, and I have some potentially useful, and perhaps even original, thoughts on these subjects. </p>

<p>Unlike all preceding computing technology with which we have become familiar, it is non-deterministic. This is a hard thing for us to thoroughly wrap our heads around. In the past, the whole point of a computer was to have a programmer write an algorithm that would consistenly produce the same results, given the same inputs. And the resulting software could be tested to verify its validity. And if the results were wrong, you could assign a programmer to go in and find the bug and fix it. If a software product needed further adjustments, you could send the dev team back to tweak it a bit. </p>
