		When I Paint My Masterpiece
	</a>
</h3>

<p>I&#8217;ve been reading Rick Rubin&#8217;s book <em><a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/717356/the-creative-act-by-rick-rubin/" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Creative Act: A Way of Being</a></em> lately &#8211; not all at once, mind you, but sipping it slowly, like a rare old whiskey &#8211; and it&#8217;s put me in mind of this song by <a href="https://www.bobdylan.com" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bob Dylan</a>, from 1971. </p>

<p>This composition has been performed and recorded by Dylan himself on multiple occasions, but the first released recording was by <a href="https://www.reasontorock.com/artists/band.html" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Band</a>, and their <a href="https://music.apple.com/us/album/when-i-paint-my-masterpiece-remastered/1440841468?i=1440841881" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">original studio recording</a> is still the version I&#8217;m partial to. </p>

<p>Let&#8217;s just review the lyrics, shall we? Ideally, of course, along with the music. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>Oh, the streets of Rome are filled with rubble.  <br />
Ancient footprints are everywhere. </p>
