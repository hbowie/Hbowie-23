		Core Beliefs

</h3>

<p>Following are the things I believe in â€” the elements of my personal belief system. Unlike many aspects of my writing, however, these are not meant to be idiosyncratic. In fact, I&#8217;m happy to offer these up as a set of principles and values that all of us might find reason to rally around here in the early stages of the 21st century. </p>

<p>These are a set of twenty-eight ideas grouped into six categories. Each idea has a tag associated with it, so feel free to click on the tag button at the end of the description for more information. </p>
