<p>I’ve been thinking a lot lately about this Grateful Dead song, written by Robert Hunter and Jerry Garcia. </p>

<p>The lyrics were famously penned by Hunter in the wake of the fateful <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altamont_Free_Concert" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Altamont Concert</a> in 1969, and in response to a <a href="https://www.dead.net/features/ralph-gleason-article-about-aftermath-altamont" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">column</a> by influential music critic Ralph J. Gleason suggesting that the Dead had some significant responsibility for the violence that occurred there. </p>

<p>But although Hunter acknowledged that he was expressing his disagreement with Gleason through the words of this song, he was never one to write with a narrow focus, and for me the heft of his work endures long beyond our interest in these events that now happened over half a century ago. </p>
