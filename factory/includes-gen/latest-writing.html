		My Education in Racial Superiority
	</a>
</h3>

<p>First things first: I am, to all appearances, white, and my ancestry, as far as it can be determined, is mostly European. </p>

<p>But please don’t hold that against me. </p>

<p>I grew up in the city of Annapolis, in the state of Maryland, over the course of the sixties. My first year in high school was also the first year of school integration in that region. </p>

<p>And I can’t, in all honesty, say that I paid much attention. There weren’t any demonstrations, there wasn’t any uproar. I did not grow up in a household that paid much attention to politics, or to the great social issues of the day. I was a great reader, and mostly consuming science fiction at that point. There were certainly people of color in our community, but I didn’t really think much about issues related to the colors of our skins. </p>

<p>But I had also developed a great love for much of the <a href="https://www.reasontorock.com" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rock music</a> of the era, including the Beatles, the Stones, the Who, and, a bit later, Cream. All white bands of course. </p>
