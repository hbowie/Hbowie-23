		1952 Vincent Black Lightning
	</a>
</h3>

<p>This is a song by English singer/songwriter/guitarist Richard Thompson. It was first released on his album <em>Rumor and Sigh</em> in 1991, but has since because a staple of his live shows — and I actually prefer some of the live renditions to the original studio version. The song was never released as a single, and so was never a hit for the general public, but it’s an easy song to appreciate, and I’ve never seen anyone give it a listen without at least liking it quite a bit. And many — including this author — believe it to be a classic. </p>

<p>It helps to understand that the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vincent_Black_Lightning" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vincent Black Lightning</a> was a real motorcycle, and a very special machine. It was produced in England from 1948 – 1952, and was designed to be as fast as possible. It broke the motorcycle land speed record of the time, going over 150 miles per hour. </p>
