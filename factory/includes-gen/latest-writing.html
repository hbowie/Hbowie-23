		The Era of Destructive Tech is Upon Us
	</a>
</h3>

<p>I wrote an essay a few years ago that asked the question: “Have We Passed The Point of Maximum Useful Tech?” </p>

<p>It was a pretty good piece, if I do say so myself, and bears rereading. </p>

<p>In it I defined a series of distinct models of computer usage that have emerged over the last several decades. </p>

<p>We’ve reached the point, though, at which I need to amend it by adding a new model that is becoming more prevalent. </p>

<p>I am forced to call it “The Destructive Model.” It is characterized by ever-higher demands for processing power without producing any significant benefits for humanity. </p>

<p>This sort of destructive tech consists primarily of new forms of so-called “artificial intelligence,” along with cryptocurrency. </p>
