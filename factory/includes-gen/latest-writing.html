		Reflections on the Christian Message
	</a>
</h3>

<p>As I’ve confessed <a href="https://hbowie.net/writings/religious-freedom.html" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on previous occasions</a>, I don’t really think of myself as a Christian, although I was raised by at least one parent who was a reliable Methodist for most of her life. </p>

<p>But I’ve been reflecting on the Christian message recently, and since Christmas is approaching, I suppose there’s no better time of year for this sort of contemplation. </p>

<p>When I think of the overarching message of Christ, three central concepts stand out for me. </p>

<h2 id="1-forgiveness-of-sin">1. Forgiveness of Sin</h2>

<blockquote>

<p>Be kind to one another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, as God in Christ forgave you. (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-32.htm" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ephesians 4:32</a>) </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>

<p>Whoever conceals his transgressions will not prosper, but he who confesses and forsakes them will obtain mercy. </p>
