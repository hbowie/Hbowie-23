		Ring Them Bells

<p>This is a gem of a Dylan song: not a big, gaudy rock, but a modest yet finely wrought masterpiece. </p>

<p>It was released in 1989 on his album <em>Oh Mercy</em>, so it&#8217;s not from any of his early years, during which his work was more consistently revered. The album was produced by Daniel Lanois, and critics are somewhat divided over the success of his efforts in rendering Dylan&#8217;s voice and compositions. </p>

<p>I find the original version by Dylan to be pretty underwhelming, but the song came alive for me when I heard it performed by Sarah Jarosz. She recorded it on her second album, <em>Follow Me Down</em>, from 2011, and she&#8217;s included it consistently in the several live shows of hers that I&#8217;ve seen. </p>

<p>For me the Dylan version seems a bit slow and somnolent, while the Jarosz version feels much more spirited. Partly, I suppose, it&#8217;s the difference between the performance of a world-weary man approaching the half-century mark, working on his 26th album, versus a youthful 20-year old working on her second. </p>
