		Some Hard Truths About Human Population Growth
	</a>
</h3>

<ol>
<li>In 1800, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_growth" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">total human population</a> on our planet was only 1 billion people. It took 127 years for that number to double to 2 billion. But then it took only 33 years to add the next billion. Since then, weâ€™ve been adding another billion every 11 - 14 years, and doubling our population about every fifty years. At this point, in 2024, we now have in excess of 8 billion people on our planet &#8211; and we&#8217;re adding another quarter million every day. </li>
<li>We live on a finite planet, with finite resources. Therefore we must recognize that the size of our human population cannot continue to grow indefinitely. </li>
<li>Past worries about population growth (see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malthusianism" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Malthusianism</a> and <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Population_Bomb" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Population Bomb</a></em>) were centered around food supplies and the possibility of widespread famine. </li>
