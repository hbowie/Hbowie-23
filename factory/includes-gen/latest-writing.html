		A Baker’s Dozen of Post-Election Thoughts & Feelings
	</a>
</h3>

<p>Here’s a quick list of thoughts and feelings coming to me one day after we’ve learned the results of the 2024 presidential election. </p>
<ol>
<li><p>Here in Seattle the sun is shining, the sky is blue, the multi-colored fall leaves are all around, and the coffee is strong. Looks like it will be another beautiful day here in the Pacific Northwest. </p></li>
<li><p>The first thing I did yesterday morning, after emptying the dishwasher and feeding the dog, was to reach out to those closest to me to see how they were doing, and to offer what comfort I could. Glad I did. That was important. </p></li>
<li><p>For my friends and family members whose candidate won, I offer my congratulations. I’m sure you’re feeling good about all of this. I’m happy for you. </p></li>
<li><p>My biggest feeling this morning is one of fear — for myself, for my family, for my country. From my perspective, Trump and the Republicans seem to be a bunch of traditional conservatism mixed in with a big bag of crazy. </p></li>
</ol>
