			<p>The press is so powerful in its image-making role, it can make the criminal look like he&#8217;s the victim and make the victim look like he&#8217;s the criminal. This is the press, an irresponsible press. If you aren&#8217;t careful, the newspapers will have you hating the people who are being oppressed and loving the people who are doing the oppressing. </p>
