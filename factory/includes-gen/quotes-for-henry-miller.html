		<h4>&ldquo;Enemies of Art and Artist&rdquo;</h4>
		
		<p class="tags-align"><a class='tag-link' href='../tags/art.html' rel='tag'>art</a></p>

		<blockquote>
			<p>Men are not suffering from the lack of good literature, good art, good theatre, good music, but from that which has made it impossible for these to become manifest. In short, they are suffering from the silent, shameful conspiracy (the more shameful since it is unacknowledged) which has bound them together as enemies of art and artist. They are suffering from the fact that art is not the primary moving force in their lives. They are suffering from the act, repeated daily, of keeping up the pretense that they can go their way, lead their lives, without art. </p>
		</blockquote>

		<p>From  the book
			<cite>Big Sur and the Oranges of Hieronymus Bosch</cite>

		<h4>&ldquo;We All Derive From the Same Source&rdquo;</h4>

		<blockquote>
			<p>Every day we slaughter our finest impulses. That is why we get a heartache when we read those lines written by the hand of a master and recognize them as our own, as the tender shoots which we stifled because we lacked the faith to believe in our own powers, our own criterion of truth and beauty. Every man, when he gets quiet, when he becomes desperately honest with himself, is capable of uttering profound truths. We all derive from the same source. there is no mystery about the origin of things. We are all part of creation, all kings, all poets, all musicians; we have only to open up, only to discover what is already there. </p>
		</blockquote>

		<p>From  the book
			<cite>Henry Miller on Writing</cite>
