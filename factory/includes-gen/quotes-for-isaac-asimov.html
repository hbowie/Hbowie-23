		<blockquote>
			<p>There is a cult of ignorance in the United States, and there always has been. The strain of anti-intellectualism has been a constant thread winding its way through our political and cultural life, nurtured by the false notion that democracy means that &#8216;my ignorance is just as good as your knowledge.&#8217; </p>
		</blockquote>

		<p>From  the story
			&ldquo;The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction&rdquo;
		</p>
		<p>&mdash; 1975</p>
