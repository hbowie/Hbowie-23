		<h4>&ldquo;Anybody can become an American&rdquo;</h4>
		
		<p class="tags-align"><a class='tag-link' href='../tags/usa.html' rel='tag'>USA</a></p>

		<blockquote>
			<p>America represents something universal in the human spirit. I received a letter not long ago from a man who said: &#8220;You can go to Japan to live, but you cannot become Japanese. You can go to France, and you&#8217;d live and not become a Frenchman. You can go to live in Germany or Turkey, and you won&#8217;t become a German or a Turk.&#8221; But then he added: &#8220;Anybody from any corner of the world can come to America to live and become an American.&#8221; </p>
