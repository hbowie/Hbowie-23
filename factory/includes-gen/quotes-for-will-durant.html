		<h4>&ldquo;Civilization defined as social order promoting cultural creation&rdquo;</h4>
		
		<p class="tags-align"><a class='tag-link' href='../tags/cultural-evolution.html' rel='tag'>cultural evolution</a></p>

		<blockquote>
			<p>We have defined civilization as “social order promoting cultural creation.” It is political order secured through custom, morals, and law, and economic order secured through a continuity of production and exchange; it is cultural creation through freedom and facilities for the origination, expression, testing, and fruition of ideas, letters, manners, and arts. It is an intricate and precarious web of human relationships, laboriously built and readily destroyed. </p>

		<h4>&ldquo;Democracy has done more good than any other form of government.&rdquo;</h4>
		
		<p class="tags-align"><a class='tag-link' href='../tags/democracy.html' rel='tag'>democracy</a> <a class='tag-link' href='../tags/governance.html' rel='tag'>governance</a></p>

		<blockquote>
			<p>All deductions having been made, democracy has done less harm, and more good, than any other form of government. It gave to human existence a zest and camaraderie that outweighed its pitfalls and defects. It gave to thought and science and enterprise the freedom essential to their operation and growth. It broke down the walls of privilege and class, and in each generation it raised up ability from every rank and place. </p>

		<h4>&ldquo;Every economic system must rely upon some form of the profit motive&rdquo;</h4>
		
		<p class="tags-align"><a class='tag-link' href='../tags/value-creation.html' rel='tag'>value creation</a></p>

		<blockquote>
			<p>The experience of the past leaves little doubt that every economic system must sooner or later rely upon some form of the profit motive to stir individuals and groups to productivity. Substitutes like slavery, police supervision, or ideological enthusiasm prove too unproductive, too expensive, or too transient. Normally and generally men are judged by their ability to produce — except in war, when they are ranked according to their ability to destroy. </p>

		<h4>&ldquo;Evolution in man has been social rather than biological&rdquo;</h4>
		
		<p class="tags-align"><a class='tag-link' href='../tags/cultural-evolution.html' rel='tag'>cultural evolution</a></p>

		<blockquote>
			<p>Evolution in man during recorded time has been social rather than biological: it has proceeded not by heritable variations in the species, but mostly by economic, political, intellectual, and moral innovation transmitted to individuals and generations by imitation, custom, or education. Custom and tradition within a group correspond to type and heredity in the species, and to instincts in the individual; they are ready adjustments to typical and frequently repeated situations. New situations, however, do arise, requiring novel, unstereotyped responses; hence development, in the higher organisms, requires a capacity for experiment and innovation — the social correlates of variation and mutation. Social evolution is an interplay of custom with origination. </p>

		<h4>&ldquo;The first condition of freedom is its limitation&rdquo;</h4>
		
		<p class="tags-align"><a class='tag-link' href='../tags/governance.html' rel='tag'>governance</a> <a class='tag-link' href='../tags/liberty.html' rel='tag'>liberty</a></p>

		<blockquote>
			<p>Since men love freedom, and the freedom of individuals in society requires some regulation of conduct, the first condition of freedom is its limitation; make it absolute and it dies in chaos. So the prime task of government is to establish order; organized central force is the sole alternative to incalculable and disruptive force in private hands. </p>

		<h4>&ldquo;The full fruitage of instruction&rdquo;</h4>
		
		<p class="tags-align"><a class='tag-link' href='../tags/education.html' rel='tag'>education</a></p>

		<blockquote>
			<p>But what would be the full fruitage of instruction if every child should be schooled till at least his twentieth year, and should find free access to the universities, libraries, and museums that harbor and offer the intellectual and artistic treasures of the race? Consider education not as the painful accumulation of facts and dates and reigns, nor merely the necessary preparation of the individual to earn his keep in the world, but as the transmission of our mental, moral, technical, and aesthetic heritage as fully as possible to as many as possible, for the enlargement of man’s understanding, control, embellishment, and enjoyment of life. </p>

		<h4>&ldquo;History is a fragment of biology&rdquo;</h4>
		
		<p class="tags-align"></p>

		<blockquote>
			<p>History is a fragment of biology: the life of man is a portion of the vicissitudes of organisms on land and sea. Sometimes, wandering alone in the woods on a summer day, we hear or see the movement of a hundred species of flying, leaping, creeping, crawling, burrowing things. The startled animals scurry away at our coming; the birds scatter; the fish disperse in the brook. Suddenly we perceive to what a perilous minority we belong on this impartial planet, and for a moment we feel, as these varied denizens clearly do, that we are passing interlopers in their natural habitat. Then all the chronicles and achievements of man fall humbly into the history and perspective of polymorphous life; all our economic competition, our strife for mates, our hunger and love and grief and war, are akin to the seeking, mating, striving, and suffering that hide under these fallen trees or leaves, or in the waters, or on the boughs. </p>

		<h4>&ldquo;Life is competition&rdquo;</h4>
		
		<p class="tags-align"><a class='tag-link' href='../tags/competition.html' rel='tag'>competition</a></p>

		<blockquote>
			<p>So the first biological lesson of history is that life is competition. Competition is not only the life of trade, it is the trade of life — peaceful when food abounds, violent when the mouths outrun the food. Animals eat one another without qualm; civilized men consume one another by due process of law. Cooperation is real, and increases with social development, but mostly because it is a tool and form of competition; we co-operate in our group — our family, community, club, church, party, “race,” or nation — in order to strengthen our group in its competition with other groups. Competing groups have the qualities of competing individuals: acquisitiveness, pugnacity, partisanship, pride. </p>

		<h4>&ldquo;Moral codes adjust themselves to conditions&rdquo;</h4>
		
		<p class="tags-align"><a class='tag-link' href='../tags/culture.html' rel='tag'>culture</a></p>

		<blockquote>
			<p>Morals are the rules by which a society exhorts (as laws are the rules by which it seeks to compel) its members and associations to behavior consistent with its order, security, and growth. A little knowledge of history stresses the variability of moral codes, and concludes that they are negligible because they differ in time and place, and sometimes contradict each other. A larger knowledge stresses the universality of moral codes, and concludes to their necessity. Moral codes differ because they adjust themselves to historical and environmental conditions. </p>

		<h4>&ldquo;No cure for racial antipathies except a broadened education&rdquo;</h4>
		
		<p class="tags-align"><a class='tag-link' href='../tags/equality.html' rel='tag'>equality</a></p>

		<blockquote>
			<p>“Racial” antipathies have some roots in ethnic origin, but they are also generated, perhaps predominantly, by differences of acquired culture — of language, dress, habits, morals, or religion. There is no cure for such antipathies except a broadened education. A knowledge of history may teach us that civilization is a cooperative product, that nearly all peoples have contributed to it; it is our common heritage and debt; and the civilized soul will reveal itself in treating every man or woman, however lowly, as a representative of one of these creative and contributory groups. </p>

		<h4>&ldquo;What History Has To Say&rdquo;</h4>
		
		<p class="tags-align"><a class='tag-link' href='../tags/history.html' rel='tag'>history</a></p>

		<blockquote>
			<p>Since man is a moment in astronomic time, a transient guest of the earth, a spore of his species, a scion of his race, a composite of body, character, and mind, a member of a family and a community, a believer or doubter of a faith, a unit in an economy, perhaps a citizen in a state or a soldier in an army, we may ask under the corresponding heads — astronomy, geology, geography, biology, ethnology, psychology, morality, religion, economics, politics, and war — what history has to say about the nature, conduct, and prospects of man. It is a precarious enterprise, and only a fool would try to compress a hundred centuries into a hundred pages of hazardous conclusions. We proceed. </p>
