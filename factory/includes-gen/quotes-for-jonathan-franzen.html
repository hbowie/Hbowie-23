		<blockquote>
			<p>The aim of the Internet and its associated technologies was to &#8220;liberate&#8221; humanity from the tasks — making things, learning things, remembering things — that had previously given meaning to life and thus had constituted life. Now it seemed as if the only task that meant anything was search-engine optimization. </p>

		<h4>&ldquo;Nature made a mockery of information technology&rdquo;</h4>
		
		<p class="tags-align"><a class='tag-link' href='../tags/wonder.html' rel='tag'>wonder</a></p>

		<blockquote>
			<p>Down in the meadow by the river rapids, by the tumble of wet boulders, a large woodpecker was drumming on a hollow tree. A buzzard eagle soared past the vertical face of a red pinnacle. Warm late-morning air currents were stirring the woods along the road, creating a tapestry of light and shadow so fine-grained and chaotic in its shiftings that no computer on earth could have modeled it. Nature even on the most local of scales made a mockery of information technology. Even augmented by tech, the human brain was paltry, infinitesimal, in comparison to the universe. </p>
