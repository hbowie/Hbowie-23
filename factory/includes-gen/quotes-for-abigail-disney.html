		<blockquote>
			<p>If I were queen of the world, I would pass a law against private jets, because they enable you to get around a certain reality. You don&#8217;t have to go through an airport terminal, you don&#8217;t have to interact, you don&#8217;t have to be patient, you don&#8217;t have to be uncomfortable. These are the things that remind us we&#8217;re human. </p>
